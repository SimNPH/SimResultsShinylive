Evaluate the Performance Characteristics of Statistical Methods for the
Analysis of Time-To-Event Data Under Non-Proportional Hazards.</p>

<p>The app takes a few minutes to load when visiting the page for the
first time or after emptying the browser cache, please be patient. This
app uses shinylive, all R code runs locally in your browser and
therefore depending on your computer and browser might be slow.</p>
<div id="browser-support" class="section level3">
<h3>Browser support</h3>
<p>Unfortunately the app does not run in a usable speed in current
Firefox releases (as of January 2024). According to the bugtracker the
firefox team is already working on the issue.<br />
Please use a chrome based browser (chrome, edge, chromium, …) in the
meantime.</p>
<p>I was not yet (January 2024) able to test the app in safari. If
loading the app or generating the plots takes long, also try using the
app from a chrome based browser.</p>
