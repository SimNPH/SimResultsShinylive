 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.12

- Provided three internal functions `html_document`, `html_vignette`, and `pdf_document` as compatibility layers to functions of the same names in the **rmarkdown** package (thanks, @jangorecki, #108). See [the appendix](https://cran.r-project.org/package=markdown/vignettes/intro.html#for-rmarkdown-users) in `vignette('intro', package = 'markdown')` for details.

- The default HTML template no longer wraps meta variables `include-before` and `include-after` inside `<div></div>`, because their values may contain incomplete HTML tags, e.g., `include-before = '<div>'` and `include-after = '</div>'`.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.11

- Verbatim code blocks of the form ```` ```{lang attr1 attr2 ...} ```` were not correctly rendered.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.10

- Raw blocks (```` ```{=lang} ````) were broken in the previous version when the support for code block attributes was added.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.9

- Added support for attributes on fenced code blocks, e.g., ```` ```{.lang .class2 #id attr="value"}```` (thanks, @thothal, #106).

- Fixed the bug that the option `number_sections: true` doesn't work for HTML output when then input contains certain Unicode characters (thanks, @fyuniv, #104).

- Added support for rendering HTML Widgets such as **ggplotly** (thanks, @fyuniv, #105).

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.8

- Fixed the superfluous warning about path lengths in `mark_html()` (thanks, @kenjisato, #103).

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.7

- The `file` argument of `mark()` will be treated as a file path only if the file exists and the value is not wrapped in `I()`. Previously, it would be treated as a file path when it has a file extension, which could lead to confusing errors like #100 (thanks, @LukasWallrich).

- When there are emojis in the text, `mark()` may fail to identify and embed web resources (thanks, @tdhock, yihui/knitr#2254).

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.6

- Added support for footnotes, fenced `Div`s, section numbers, `{}` attributes for images/headings/fenced `Div`s, and appendices. See `vignette('intro', package = 'markdown')` for details.

- A lot of enhancements to the HTML slides format. See `vignette('slides', package = 'markdown')` for details.

- Added `vignette('article', package = 'markdown')` to demonstrate how to write an HTML article.

- If the input to `mark()` is a file, the output will also be a file by default. Previously the output would be text. If you want `mark()` to return text output when the input is a file, you may specify the argument `output = NULL`.

- The Markdown option `base64_images` has been renamed to `embed_resources`. This option can take two possible values, `"local"` and `"https"`, meaning whether to embed local and/or web (https) resources. You can specify none, either, or both of them. See `vignette('intro', package = 'markdown')` for details.

- Removed the option `standalone` from the list of Markdown options. Please use the argument `template = TRUE/FALSE` of `mark()` instead. The option `standalone = TRUE` was equivalent to `template = TRUE`.

- Added the option `auto_identifiers` (enabled by default) to automatically add IDs to headings, e.g., `# Hello world!` will be converted to `<h1 id="hello-world">Hello world!</h1>`. You can certainly override the automatic ID by providing an ID manually via the `{#id}` attribute, e.g., `# Hello world! {#hello}`.

- Renamed the `mathjax` option to `js_math` to allow for other JS math libraries. The default library was changed from MathJax to KaTeX. To continue using MathJax, you may set `js_math: mathjax`.

- Removed the option `mathjax_embed` from the list of Markdown options. To embed the MathJax library, enable `"https"` in the `embed_resources` option instead. Note that only MathJax v3 can be partially embedded, and lower versions cannot.

- Renamed the option `highlight_code` to `js_highlight`, and added support for an alternative syntax highlighting JS library Prism.js, which became the default. To continue using the old default `highlight.js`, you may set the `js_highlight` option to `highlight`.

- The default version of MathJax has been changed from v2 to v3.

- The default version of highlight.js has been changed from 11.6.0 to 11.7.0, and the default style has been switched from `github` to `xcode`.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.5

- Values of meta variables `title`, `author`, and `date` (if provided) will be transformed to the target output format before they are passed into templates.

- Fixed the bug that the default CSS was not added to HTML output.

- Removed dependency on the **mime** package.

- Added experimental support for HTML slides: `markdown::mark_html(..., meta = list(css = c('default', 'slides'), js = 'slides'))`. If you prefer knitting `Rmd` documents in RStudio, you may use the output format:

  ```yaml
  output:
    markdown::html_format:
      meta:
        css: [default, slides]
        js: [slides]
  ```

  See https://yihui.org/en/2023/01/minimal-r-markdown/ for a demo.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.4

- Empty `\title{}` in LaTeX output will be removed (along with `\maketitle`).

- highlight.js is loaded from https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release by default now. This means more languages are supported (not only R), but also means syntax-highlighting will not work offline at the moment (it will be improved in future).

- MathJax failed to load in the previous version. The bug has been fixed now.

- Removed the function `markdownExtensions()`.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.3

- Switched the underlying Markdown rendering engine from the C library **sundown** (which has been deprecated for a decade) to the R package **commonmark** (thanks, @jeroen, yihui/knitr#1329).

- The functions `renderMarkdown()` and `markdownToHTML()` have been renamed to `mark()` and `mark_html()`, respectively. The old names are still kept in this package for backward-compatibility.

- Removed the arguments `stylesheet` and `fragment.only` in `mark_html()`. For `stylesheet`, please use the argument `meta = list(css = ...)` to provide the CSS stylesheet. For `fragment.only`, please use `mark_html(template = FALSE)` or `mark_html(options = '-standalone')` instead of `fragment.only = TRUE`. Currently these old arguments are still accepted internally, but may be deprecated and dropped in the long run.

- The `file` argument of `mark()` and `mark_html()` can also take a character vector of Markdown text now.

- Removed functions `rendererExists()`, `rendererOutputType()`, and `registeredRenderer()`. They were primarily for internal use.

- Deprecated the function `markdownExtensions()`. All extensions should be specified via the `options` argument of functions like `mark()`, e.g., `mark(options = '+table+tasklist')`. See all options on the help page `?markdown::markdown_options`.

- Renamed `markdownHTMLOptions()` to `markdown_options()`.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.2

- Fixed the warnings "a function declaration without a prototype is deprecated in all versions of C" (#94).

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.1

## MAJOR CHANGES

- renderMarkdown() and markdownToHTML() will signal an error if the input file is not encoded in "UTF-8".

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 1.0

## MAJOR CHANGES

- The default value of the encoding argument of renderMarkdown() and markdownToHTML() has been changed from getOption("encoding") to "UTF-8". The encoding of the input file will always be assumed to be UTF-8.

- markdownToHTML() will return a character vector encoded in UTF-8 (instead of the system's native encoding) when not writing to an output file.

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.9

## BUG FIXES

- Fixed clang-UBSAN and valgrind issues (thanks, @yixuan, #92).

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.8

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.7.7

## BUG FIXES

- renderMarkdown() works now even if text = character(0) or ""

- added an `encoding` argument to renderMarkdown() since multi-byte characters in renderMarkdown() did not work on Windows (thanks, Kohske Takahashi, #63)

- fixed #64: invalid 'n' argument in rpubsUpload() (thanks, Wouter van Atteveldt)

## MAJOR CHANGES

- if renderMarkdown() returns a character vector, it will be marked with the UTF-8 encoding if it contains multi-byte characters

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.7.4

## NEW FEATURES

- when an image is the only element of its parent node in the HTML output document, it is automatically centered on the page

## MINOR CHANGES

- fixed #60: MathJax may be included even if it is unnecessary when syntax highlighting is enabled (thanks, @aoles)

- fixed a bug which may hang R when building R Markdown vignettes in a wrong locale (thanks, Dan Tenenbaum, yihui/knitr#782)

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.7

## BUG FIXES

- if both the 'file' and 'text' arguments are provided but file = NULL, e.g. markdownToHTML(file = NULL, text = ?), markdownToHTML() can throw an error indicating the file is invalid (thanks, Tyler Rinker, hadley/staticdocs#66)

- markdownToHTML(text = ?, output = ?) was broken (#54)

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.6.5

## NEW FEATURES

- added an argument 'encoding' to markdownToHTML() to specify the character encoding of the input markdown file, and the HTML output file is always encoded in UTF-8 now (thanks, Kohske Takahashi, #50)

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.6.4

## NEW FEATURES

- added 'mathjax_embed' to HTML options for embedding the MathJax JavaScript in the HTML document rather than linking to it online. Note the JavaScript code is read from the http instead of https MathJax URL. Contributed by Henrik Bengtsson.

- added another vignette to show the HTML output of the original vignette (see browseVignettes('markdown'))

- the default CSS style was tweaked (major changes include: page width is at most 800px, more line height, slightly larger fonts, and a different syntax highlighting theme)

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.6.3

## NEW FEATURES

- added a new argument 'template' to markdownToHTML() so that we can customize the HTML template (by default, it uses the template 'resources/markdown.html' in this package); thanks, Nacho Caballero

- the options markdown.HTML.stylesheet and markdown.HTML.header used in markdownToHTML() can be character vectors (they will be processed by paste(x, collapse = '\n')

## MAJOR CHANGES

- the 'text' argument in markdownToHTML() and renderMarkdown() is treated as lines of input now, i.e. if 'text' is provided, it is passed to the markdown renderer as paste(text, collapse = '\n'); in the previous versions, it was processed by paste(text, collapse = '')

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.6

## DOCUMENTATION

- added a package vignette; see browseVignettes(package = 'markdown')

# CHANGES IN markdown VERSION 0.5.5

## NEW FEATURES

## BUG FIXES

- fixed #25 and #27: minor documentation problems

- fixed #26: the HTML output file will be written relative to the current working directory now when it contains images that need to be base64 encoded

The R package [**markdown**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=markdown) can be
used to generate lightweight HTML documents with minimal default CSS styles. If
you are not familiar with this package, you may read [the
introduction](intro.html)[^1] first to learn the basics. The HTML format is
highly customizable if you know some CSS and JavaScript. This article
demonstrates an HTML article format by introducing external CSS and JavaScript
to the base format.

[^1]: The package vignette: `vignette("intro", package = "markdown")`

## Get started

To write an HTML article, you may use the following metadata variables (`css`
and `js`):[^2]

[^2]: If you are curious about what the leading `@` characters mean in the
    values, please read the section "YAML metadata" in the introduction vignette
    of this package.

``` yaml
output:
  markdown::html_format:
    meta:
      css: ["default", "@xiee/utils/css/article.min.css"]
      js: ["@xiee/utils/js/sidenotes.min.js,appendix.min.js"]
```

The `default` CSS is the default style provided by this package. Beyond that,
only the CSS file `article.css`[^3] is required.

[^3]: The actual file extension is `.min.css`, which means a *minified* version
    of the `.css`. The CSS is minified to make it load faster. If you do not
    care, you can definitely use the `.css` extension. The same thing applies to
    `.min.js` vs `.js`.

-   The JS file `sitenotes.js` is required only if you want to place certain
    elements on the left or right side, such as the table of contents (TOC),
    footnotes, and sidenotes.

-   The JS file `appendix.js` is required only if you have an appendix in the
    article.

Since we are going to demonstrate all elements, we have loaded both JS files for
this document.

## The overall style

The maximum width of the article body is 800px. For larger screens, this means
there will be extra space in the left/right margin, where we can place auxiliary
information, such as the TOC and footnotes. On smaller screens, the side content
will be collapsed into the body.

The article frontmatter, body, and optionally the appendix are placed in
separate boxes.

The default typeface is sans-serif, and you can customize it by supplying an
external CSS file (via the `css` meta variable) or just embedding CSS in the
document body, e.g.,

```{css}
body {
  font-family: Palatino, "Book Antiqua", Georgia, serif;
  font-size: 1em;
}
```

## Side elements

The TOC and footnotes are automatically placed in the margin if space permits.
You can also write arbitrary content in the margin via a fenced `Div`.

### The TOC

The TOC is sticky on the left side as you scroll down the article. If you do not
like this behavior, you may cancel it via CSS:

``` css
#TOC {
  top: unset;
}
```

### Footnotes

Footnotes are moved to the right side. When you move your cursor over a footnote
number in the body, the footnote will be moved next to your cursor. This can be
convenient when you have multiple footnotes on a line, since you do not need to
look for a specific footnote in the margin.

### Arbitrary sidenotes

You can write anything in the margin by using a fenced `Div` with the classes
`.side` and `.side-left` or `.side-right`.

::: {.side .side-left}
**Notice**

Here is a note on the left side. Anything permitted by law is permitted here.
Math? No problem!

$$e^{i\theta}=\sin{\theta}+i\cos{\theta}$$

When you have this sidenote "hammer", I'm sure you will hit a lot of nails into
the margin, even if you do not have to.
:::

::: {.side .side-right}
And here is a note on the right side. Seriously, we should let
[commonmark](https://commonmark.org)'s authors know that fenced `Div`s really
deserve first-class support! They can make Markdown infinitely customizable.
:::

``` markdown
::: {.side .side-left}
**Anything** on the left.
:::
```

``` markdown
::: {.side .side-right}
_Anything_ on the right.
:::
```

## Body elements

Inside the article body, you can write a few special elements.

### Full-width elements

When an element is wider than the article body, you can show it in its full
width by enclosing the element in a fenced `Div` with the class `.fullwidth`,
e.g.,

``` markdown
::: {.fullwidth}
![text](path/to/image)
:::
```

::: fullwidth
![Sunspots](https://prose.yihui.org/post/2020/11/10/r-markdown-demo/index_files/figure-html/sunspots-1.svg)
:::

If you use R Markdown, you can generate a wide plot or table from an R code
chunk, e.g.,

````{verbatim, lang='markdown'}
::: {.fullwidth}
```{r}
#| sunspots, echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(14, 4),
#| fig.cap='Monthly mean relative sunspot numbers from 1749 to 1983.'
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1), bg = 'lightgoldenrodyellow', fg = 'red', las = 1)
plot(sunspots, col = 'red', panel.first = grid())
```
:::
````

### Left/right quotes

::: quote-right
> Whenever you find that you are on the side of the majority, it is time to
> pause and reflect.
>
> ---[Mark Twain](http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes/Mark_Twain/81)
:::

Sometimes you may want to add a quote but do not want it to take the full width
in the body. You may use a fenced `Div` with the class `.quote-left` or
`.quote-right`.

Despite the class names, the content does not have to be a quote. If you do want
a quote, just use the blockquote syntax `>`, e.g.,

``` markdown
::: {.quote-right}
> This is a boring quote.
>
> ---Someone
:::
```

### Margin embedding

::: embed-right
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 4))
```
:::

You can embed elements on the left or right margin using a fenced `Div` with the
class `.embed-left` or `.embed-right`. These elements will float to the left or
right and exceed the margin by about 200px, which can save some space in the
article body. You can use the extra space to explain the embedded element with
text.

We have embedded a table of the first 4 rows of the `mtcars` data on the right
margin. The table was generated via `knitr::kable()`.

## Appendix {.appendix}

The appendix starts with a heading that has the attribute `.appendix`, e.g.,
`## Appendix {.appendix}`.

## Technical notes

It's quite simple to move an element into the margin using CSS. For example, the
`.side-right` class in this article is roughly defined as:

``` css
.side-right {
  width: 200px;
  float: right;
  margin-right: -200px
}
```

That basically means the width of the element is 200px and it floats to the
right. Now its right side will touch the right margin of its parent element (the
article body). What we need to do next is move it further to the right by 200px
(i.e., its width), which is done by the `-200px` right margin. Remember, a
positive right margin in CSS moves an element to the left, and a negative right
margin moves it to the right.

<p>The R package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=markdown"><strong>markdown</strong></a> can be
used to generate lightweight HTML documents with minimal default CSS styles. If
you are not familiar with this package, you may read <a href="intro.html">the
introduction</a><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1" data-footnote-ref>1</a></sup> first to learn the basics. The HTML format is
highly customizable if you know some CSS and JavaScript. This article
demonstrates an HTML article format by introducing external CSS and JavaScript
to the base format.</p>
<h2 id="get-started"><span class="section-number">1.</span> Get started</h2>
<p>To write an HTML article, you may use the following metadata variables (<code>css</code>
and <code>js</code>):<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2" data-footnote-ref>2</a></sup></p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">output:

      js: [&quot;@xiee/utils/js/sidenotes.min.js,appendix.min.js&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>default</code> CSS is the default style provided by this package. Beyond that,
only the CSS file <code>article.css</code><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-3" id="fnref-3" data-footnote-ref>3</a></sup> is required.</p>

elements on the left or right side, such as the table of contents (TOC),
footnotes, and sidenotes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The JS file <code>appendix.js</code> is required only if you have an appendix in the
article.</p>
</li>

The **markdown** package is built on top of **commonmark**. It renders Markdown
to output formats supported by **commonmark**, and the primary output formats
are HTML and LaTeX.

Historically, it uses a C library named **sundown**, which has been deleted and
replaced by **commonmark** since v1.3 (2022-10-30). The main advantage of the
latter is that it follows a clear and widely used spec, i.e., GFM ([GitHub
Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)), which can be seen as a
subset of [Pandoc's Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown).
Therefore the **markdown** package can be viewed as a small subset of the
**rmarkdown** package (the latter is based on Pandoc but the former doesn't
depend on external tools). It aims at simplicity, lightweight, and speed, at the
cost of giving up a lot of features. This package is intended for minimalists.
Most users may want to use tools based on Pandoc instead, such as **rmarkdown**
or Quarto.

## Markdown Syntax

### Basic syntax

For the full list of supported document elements, please read the GFM spec.
Below is a quick summary:

-   Headings start with a number of `#`'s, e.g., `## level-two heading`.

-   Inline elements: `**strong**`, `_emphasis_`, `~~strikethrough~~`,
    `[text](link)`, and `![alt](image/path)`.[^1]

-   Inline code is written in a pair of backticks, e.g., `` `code` ``. Code
    blocks can be indented, or fenced by ```` ``` ````.

-   List items start with `-`, `+`, or `*`, e.g., `- item`. A task list item is
    a regular list item with `[ ]` or `[x]` in the beginning, e.g.,
    `- [ ] item`.

-   Block quotes start with `>`.

-   Tables are created with `|` as the column separator (i.e., Pandoc's pipe
    table, which can be generated by `knitr::kable(x, "pipe")`).

[^1]: Please note that for links and images, their URLs [should not contain
    spaces](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/#link-destination). If they do,
    the URLs must be enclosed in `<>`, e.g.,
    `![alt](<some dir/a subdir/foo.png>).`

### Add-on features

In addition to GFM features, the **markdown** package also supports the
following features.

#### Raw LaTeX/HTML blocks

Raw LaTeX and HTML blocks can be written as fenced code blocks with language
names `=latex` (or `=tex`) and `=html`, e.g.,

```` markdown
```{=tex}
This only appears in \LaTeX{} output.
```
````

Raw LaTeX blocks will only appear in LaTeX output, and will be ignored in other
output formats. Similarly, raw HTML blocks will only appear in HTML output. One
exception is raw LaTeX blocks that are LaTeX math environments, which also work
for HTML output (see the next section).

#### LaTeX math

You can write both `$inline$` and `$$display$$` LaTeX math, e.g.,
$\sin^{2}(\theta)+\cos^{2}(\theta) = 1$

$$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$

$$|x| = \begin{cases}
x &\text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x &\text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}$$

LaTeX math environments are also supported, e.g., below are an `align`
environment and an `equation` environment:

```{=latex}
\begin{align}
a^{2}+b^{2} & =  c^{2}\\
\sin^{2}(\theta)+\cos^{2}(\theta) & =  1
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(a+b)^2 &=(a+b)(a+b)\\
  &=a^2+2ab+b^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}
```
These math environments can be written in raw LaTeX blocks, and they work for
both LaTeX and HTML output, e.g.,

```` markdown
```{=latex}
\begin{align}
a^{2}+b^{2} & =  c^{2}\\
\sin^{2}(\theta)+\cos^{2}(\theta) & =  1
\end{align}
```
````

For HTML output, it is up to the JavaScript library (MathJax or KaTeX) whether a
math environment can be rendered.

#### Superscripts and subscripts

Write superscripts in `^text^` and subscripts in `~text~` (same syntax as
Pandoc's Markdown), e.g., 2^10^ and H~2~O. Currently only alphanumeric
characters, `*`, `(`, and `)` are allowed in the scripts. For example, `a^b c^`
will not be recognized as a superscript (because the space is not allowed). Note
that GFM supports striking out text via `~text~`, but this feature has been
disabled and replaced by the feature of subscripts in **markdown**. To strike
out text, you must use a pair of *double* tildes.

#### Footnotes

Insert footnotes via `[^n]`, where `n` is a footnote number (a unique
identifier). The footnote content should be defined in a separate block starting
with `[^n]:`. For example:

``` markdown
Insert a footnote here.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote.
```

The support is limited for LaTeX output at the moment,[^2] and there are two
caveats if the document is intended to be converted to LaTeX:

[^2]: If you know C, I'll truly appreciate it if you could help with the LaTeX
    implementation in GFM: <https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/issues/314>

-   The footnote content must be a single paragraph.

-   Only numbers[^3] are supported as identifiers, and other types of
    identifiers are not recognized.

[^3]: The specific number doesn't matter, as long as it's a unique footnote
    number in the document. For example, the first footnote can be `[^100]` and
    the second can be `[^64]`. Eventually they will appear as `[1]` and `[2]`.
    If you use the RStudio visual editor to edit Markdown documents, the
    footnote numbers will be automatically generated and updated when new
    footnotes are inserted before existing footnotes.

The two limitations do not apply to HTML output, e.g., you can write arbitrary
elements in footnotes and not necessarily one paragraph.

#### Attributes

Attributes on images, fenced code blocks, and section headings can be written in
`{}`. For example, `![text](path){.foo #bar width="50%"}` will generate an
`<img>` tag with attributes in HTML output:

``` html
<img src="path" alt="text" id="bar" class="foo" width="50%" />
```

and `## Heading {#baz}` will generate:

``` html
<h2 id="baz">Heading</h2>
```

For fenced code blocks, a special rule is that the first class name will be
treated as the language name for a block, and the `class` attribute of the
result `<code>` tag will have a `language-` prefix. For example, the following
code block

```` markdown
```{.foo .bar #my-code style="color: red;"}
```
````

will generate the HTML output below:

``` html
<pre>
  <code class="language-foo bar" id="my-code" style="color: red;">
  </code>
</pre>
```

Most attributes in `{}` are ignored for LaTeX output except for:

-   The `width` attribute for images, e.g., `![text](path){width="50%"}` will be
    converted to `\includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{path}`.

-   The `.unnumbered` attribute, which will make a heading unnumbered, e.g.,
    `# Hello {.unnumbered}` will be converted to `\section*{Hello}`.

-   The `.appendix` attribute on a heading, which will start the appendix, e.g.,
    `# Appendix {.appendix}` will be converted to `\appendix`.

#### Appendices

When a top-level heading has the attribute `.appendix`, the rest of the document
will be treated as the appendix. If [section numbering](#number-sections) is
enabled, the appendix section headings will be numbered differently.

#### Fenced `Div`s

A fenced `Div` can be written in `:::` fences. Note that the opening fence must
have at least one attribute, such as the class name. For example:

``` markdown
::: foo
This is a fenced Div.
:::

::: {.foo}
The syntax `::: foo` is equivalent to `::: {.foo}`.
:::

::: {.foo #bar style="color: red;"}
This div has more attributes.

It will be red in HTML output.
:::
```

A fenced `Div` will be converted to `<div>` with attributes in HTML output,
e.g.,

``` html
<div class="foo" id="bar" style="color: red;">
</div>
```

For LaTeX output, it can be converted to a LaTeX environment if both the class
name and an attribute `data-latex` are present. For example,

``` markdown
::: {.tiny data-latex=""}
This is _tiny_ text.
:::
```

will be converted to:

``` latex
\begin{tiny}
This is \emph{tiny} text.
\end{tiny}
```

The `data-latex` attribute can be used to specify arguments to the environment
(which can be an empty string if the environment doesn't need an argument). For
example,

``` markdown
::: {.minipage data-latex="{.5\linewidth}"}
```

will be converted to:

``` latex
\begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
```

If a fenced `Div` doesn't have the `data-latex` attribute, the fence will be
ignored, and its content will be written out normally without a surrounding
environment. If a fenced `Div` has multiple class names (e.g., `{.a .b .c}`),
only the first class name will be used as the LaTeX environment name. However,
all class names will be used if the output format is HTML (e.g.,
`<div class="a b c">`).

#### Smart HTML entities

"Smart" HTML entities can be represented by ASCII characters, e.g., you can
write fractions in the form `n/m`. Below are some example entities:

```{r, smartypants, echo=FALSE, eval=isTRUE(l10n_info()[['UTF-8']])}
p = markdown:::pants[-(4:14)]
knitr::kable(t(as.matrix(p)), col.names = sprintf('`%s`', names(p)))
```

### Comparison to Pandoc

As mentioned earlier, a lot of features in Pandoc's Markdown are not supported
in the **markdown** package. Any feature that you find missing in previous
sections is likely to be unavailable, such as citations and figure/table
captions. In addition, a lot of R Markdown and Quarto (both are based on Pandoc)
features are not supported, either. Some HTML features may be implemented via
JavaScript, but currently it is not straightforward and may be improved in
future.

Pandoc can convert Markdown to many output formats, such as Word, PowerPoint,
LaTeX beamer, and EPUB. The **markdown** package is unlikely to support output
formats beyond HTML and LaTeX.

## Markdown Rendering

The main function to convert Markdown to other formats is `markdown::mark()`;
`mark_html()` and `mark_latex()` are simple wrapper functions for HTML and LaTeX
output, respectively. The function `mark()` generates a document fragment by
default, and the wrapper functions `mark_*()` generates full documents.

You can either call `markdown::mark()` to render a Markdown document
programmatically, or click the `Knit` button in RStudio to render a (Markdown or
R Markdown) document interactively. The latter requires you to specify the
output format in the `output` field in YAML metadata (see the section "[YAML
metadata](#yaml-metadata)"), e.g.,

``` yaml
---
output:
  markdown::html_format:
    options:
      js_math:
        package: "katex"
        version: "0.16.4"
      number_sections: true
      embed_resources: ["local", "https"]
    meta:
      css: "custom.css"
---
```

### Markdown options

The `options` argument of `mark()` can be used to enable/disable/set options to
control Markdown rendering. This argument can take either a list, e.g.,
`list(toc = TRUE, smart = FALSE)`, or a character vector, e.g.,
`c("+toc", "-smart")`, or equivalently, `+toc-smart`, where `+` means to enable
an option, and `-` means to disable an option. The options can also be set in
[YAML metadata](#yaml-metadata) (recommended). Available options are listed
below.

#### `auto_identifiers`

Add automatic IDs to headings, e.g.,

``` markdown
# Hello world!
```

will be converted to

``` html
<h1 id="hello-world">Hello world!</h1>
```

You can override the automatic ID by providing an ID manually via the ID
attribute, e.g.,

``` markdown
# Hello world! {#hello}
```

An automatic ID is generated by substituting non-alphanumeric characters in the
heading text with hyphens. If the result is empty, the ID will be `section`. If
any ID is duplicated, a numeric suffix will be added to the ID, e.g.,
`example_1` and `example_2`.

#### `embed_resources`

Embed resources (images, CSS, and JS) in the HTML output using their
base64-encoded data (images) or raw content (CSS/JS). Possible values are:

-   `null` or `false`: Do not embed any resources.

-   `"local"` or `true`: Embed local image/CSS/JS files.

-   `"https"`: Embed web resources (links that start with `https://`).

-   `"all"`: An alias to the union of `"local"` and `"https"`.

The default is `"local"`, i.e., local resources are embedded, whereas `https`
resources are not. This means the output document may not work offline. If you
have to view the output offline, you need to use the option value `"https"` (or
`"all"`) and render the document at least once before you go offline.

#### `js_highlight`

Specify the JavaScript library to syntax highlight code blocks. Possible values
are `highlight` ([highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org)) and `prism`
([Prism.js](https://prismjs.com)). The default is `prism`. This option can also
take a list of the form `list(package, version, style, languages)`, which
specifies the package name (`highlight` or `prism`), version, CSS style/theme
name, and names of languages to be highlighted.

-   You can find information about Prism.js from its CDN at
    <https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prismjs/>. Available styles are under the
    `themes/` directory (e.g., `prism-dark`), and languages are under the
    `components/` directory (e.g., `prism-c`). You can omit the prefix `prism-`,
    e.g.,

    ``` yaml
    js_highlight:
      package: prism
      style: dark
      languages: [r, latex, yaml]
    ```

-   The CDN of highlight.js is at
    <https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release/build/>. Themes are
    under the `styles/` directory (e.g., `github`), and you can find demos of
    themes at <https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/>. Supported language are
    under the `languages/` directory (e.g., `latex`).

By default, languages are automatically detected and the required JS files are
automatically loaded. Normally you need to specify the `languages` array only if
the automatic detection fails.

Technically this option is a shorthand for setting the [metadata
variables](#yaml-metadata) `css` and `js`. If you want full control, you may
disable this option (set it to `false` or `null`) and use metadata variables
directly, which requires more familiarity with the JS libraries and the jsdelivr
CDN.

#### `js_math`

Specify the JavaScript library for rendering math expressions in HTML output.
Possible values are `"mathjax"` and `"katex"` (the default). Like the
`js_highlight` option, this option is also essentially a shorthand for setting
the metadata variables `css` and `js`.

-   For [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted), the `js` variable is
    set to `tex-mml-chtml.js`.

-   For [KaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/browser.html), the `js` variable is set
    to `katex.min.js` and the `css` variable is set to `katex.min.css`. KaTeX's
    `auto-render` extension (`auto-render.min.js`) is also enabled by default,
    so math expressions can be immediately rendered when the page is loaded.

If you want finer control, you can provide a list of the form
`list(package, version, css, js)`. This will allow you to specify the package
name, version, and css/js files. For example, if you want to use MathJax's
`tex-chtml.js` instead, you may set:

``` yaml
js_math:
  package: mathjax
  version: 3
  js: es5/tex-chtml.js
```

By default, MathJax version 3 is used. If you want to use the older v2, you may
set:

``` yaml
js_math:
  package: mathjax
  version: 2
  js: MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_CHTML
```

Please visit [the MathJax CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax/) to know
which versions and JS files are available.

For KaTeX, the version is not specified by default, which means the latest
version from [the CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex/). Below is an example
of specifying the version 0.16.4 and using the `mhchem` extension:

``` yaml
js_math:
  package: katex
  version: 0.16.4
  js: [dist/katex.min.js, dist/contrib/mhchem.min.js]
```

Note that if you want the HTML output to be self-contained via the
`embed_resources` option, KaTeX can be embedded and used offline, but MathJax
cannot be fully embedded due to its complexity. MathJax v3 can be partially
embedded and used offline, but currently only its fonts can be embedded, and
extensions cannot. If you must view HTML output offline, we recommend using
KaTeX, but please also note that KaTeX and MathJax do not fully cover each
other's features.

#### `latex_math`

Whether to identify LaTeX math expressions in pairs of single (`$ $`) or double
dollar signs (`$$ $$`), and transform them so that they could be correctly
rendered by MathJax (HTML output) or LaTeX.

#### `number_sections`

Whether to number section headings. To skip numbering a specific heading, add an
attribute `{.unnumbered}` to it.

#### `smartypants`

Whether to translate certain ASCII strings into smart typographic characters
(see `?markdown::smartypants`).

#### `superscript`

Whether to translate strings between two carets into superscripts, e.g.,
`text^foo^` to `text<sup>foo</sup>`.

#### `subscript`

Whether to translate strings between two tildes into subscripts, e.g.,
`text~foo~` to `text<sub>foo</sub>`.

#### `toc`

Whether to generate a table of contents (TOC) from section headings. If a
heading has an `id` attribute, the corresponding TOC item will be a link to this
heading. You can also set a sub-option:

-   `depth`: The number of section levels to include in the TOC (`3` by
    default). Setting `toc` to `true` is equivalent to:

    ``` yaml
    toc:
      depth: 3
    ```

#### `top_level`

The desired type of the top-level headings in LaTeX output. Possible values are
`'chapter'` and `'part'`. For example, if `top_level = 'chapter'`, `# heading`
will be rendered to `\chapter{heading}` instead of the default
`\section{heading}`.

Options not described above can be found on the help pages of **commonmark**,
e.g., the `hardbreaks` option is for the `hardbreaks` argument of
`commonmark::markdown_*()` functions, and the `table` option is for the `table`
extension in **commonmark**'s extensions.

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
markdown::markdown_options()
# commonmark's arguments
opts = formals(commonmark::markdown_html)
opts = opts[setdiff(names(opts), c('text', 'extensions'))]
unlist(opts)
# commonmark's extensions
commonmark::list_extensions()
```

### Templates

By default, `mark()` generates a document fragment (i.e., the body). To generate
a full document, you need a template. Below is a simple HTML template example:

``` html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>$title$</title>
  </head>

  <body>
  $body$
  </body>
</html>
```

It contains two variables, `$title$` and `$body$`. All variables will be
substituted by metadata values, except for `$body$`, which takes the value from
`mark()`.

The **markdown** has provided default templates for
[HTML](https://github.com/rstudio/markdown/blob/master/inst/resources/markdown.html)
and
[LaTeX](https://github.com/rstudio/markdown/blob/master/inst/resources/markdown.latex)
output. To use them, call `mark(..., template = TRUE)`, or the wrapper functions
`mark_html()` / `mark_latex()`. To pass metadata to templates, use the `meta`
argument, e.g.,

``` r
markdown::mark(..., meta = list(title = "My Title"), template = TRUE)
```

You can provide your own template file to the `template` argument, too.

### YAML metadata {#yaml-metadata}

Alternatively, the `meta` argument can read YAML metadata in the Markdown
document. The following variables can be set in the top-level fields in YAML:

-   `author`: The document author(s).

-   `date`: The date.

-   `title`: The document title.

For example:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Title"
author: "[Frida Gomam](https://example.com)"
date: "2023-01-09"
---
```

Note that you can use Markdown syntax in them.

Other variables need to be specified under
`output -> markdown::*_format -> meta`, where `*` can be `html` or `latex`,
e.g.,

``` yaml
---
title: "My Title"
output:
  markdown::html_format:
    meta:
      css: "style.css"
      js: "script.js"
  markdown::latex_format:
    meta:
      documentclass: "book"
      header_includes: "\\usepackage{microtype}"
---
```

The following metadata variables are supported for both HTML and LaTeX
templates:

-   `header-includes`, `include-before`, `include-after`: Either a vector of
    (HTML/LaTeX) code or a code file to be included in the header, before the
    body, or after the body of the output.

Variables specific to the HTML template:

-   `css`: A vector of CSS files to be included in the output. The default value
    is `markdown:::pkg_file('resources', 'default.css')`.

    If you want to use built-in CSS files in this package, you can only specify
    the base name, e.g., `default` means `default.css` in this package.

    You can also use web resources, e.g., `https://example.org/style.css`. One
    special case is [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com) resources: if a `css`
    value starts with `@`, it will be recognized as a jsdelivr.com resource. if
    you are not familiar with jsdelivr, you may read its documentation to
    understand the following example URLs. The shorthand syntax is as follows
    (`...` stands for `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net`):

    -   `@foo` will be converted to
        `.../gh/rstudio/markdown/inst/resources/foo`, e.g., `@default` means
        `.../gh/rstudio/markdown/inst/resources/default.css`.

    -   `@path/to/file` (i.e., a value that contains slashes) will be converted
        to `.../path/to/file`, e.g., `@npm/@xiee/utils/js/center-img.js` will be
        converted to `.../npm/@xiee/utils/js/center-img.min.js`.

    -   `@path/to/file-1,file-2` (comma-separated values and later values do not
        contain slashes) will be converted to
        `.../combine/path/to/file-1,path/to/file-2` (this can be useful to
        [combine](https://www.jsdelivr.com/documentation#id-combine-multiple-files)
        multiple resources and load all at once).

    -   `@path-1/to/file-1,path-2/to/file-2` (comma-separated values and later
        values contain slashes) will be converted to
        `.../combine/path-1/to/file-1,path-2/to/file-2`.

    This provides a way to reduce the output HTML file size by loading CSS from
    the web instead of embedding inside HTML, at the cost of requiring Internet
    connection when viewing the HTML file. If you need the external web
    resources to work after you go offline, you can enable `"https"` in the
    Markdown option `embed_resources` in advance to embed the resources.

-   `js`: A vector of JavaScript files to be included in the output. The syntax
    is the same as the `css` variable, e.g., `snap` means `snap.js` in this
    package, and `@snap` means a "jsdelivr" resource.

Variables specific to the LaTeX template:

-   `classoption`: A string containing options for the document class.

-   `documentclass`: The document class (by default, `article`).

Note that you can use either underscores or hyphens in the variable names.
Underscores will be normalized to hyphens internally, e.g., `header_includes`
will be converted to `header-includes`. This means if you use a custom template,
you must use hyphens instead of underscores as separators in variable names in
the template.

The above are variables supported in the default templates. If you use a custom
template, you can use arbitrary variable names consisting of alphanumeric
characters and hyphens, except for `$body$` (which is a reserved name), and your
metadata values will be passed to these variables in your template.

Besides metadata variables, the aforementioned Markdown options can also be set
in YAML under `output -> markdown::*_format -> options`, e.g.,

``` yaml
output:
  markdown::html_format:
    options:
      toc: true
      js_highlight:
        package: highlight
        theme: github
        languages: [diff, latex]
```

See the help page `?markdown::html_format` for possible fields in addiction to
`meta` and `options` that can be specified under the format name, e.g.,

``` yaml
output:
  markdown::latex_format:
    latex_engine: xelatex
    keep_md: true
    template: custom-template.tex
```

## Applications

The **markdown** package aims at lightweight with a minimal number of features.
You can build lightweight applications on top of it. In this section, we
introduce some example applications.

### HTML slides

With an extra CSS file and a JS file, you can create lightweight HTML slides:

``` yaml
---
output:
  markdown::html_format:
    meta:
      css: [default, slides]
      js: [slides]
---
```

You can learn more in [`vignette('slides', package = 'markdown')`](slides.html).

### HTML articles

Similarly, you can write an HTML article with extra CSS and JS. Learn more about
it in [`vignette('article', package = 'markdown')`](article.html).

### External JS/CSS

You can load arbitrary external JS and CSS files via the `js` and `css`
variables. There are numerous JS libraries and CSS frameworks on the web. Here
we will only use the JS/CSS from the repo <https://github.com/yihui/misc.js> to
show a few brief examples.

#### Tabbed sections

You can load the script `tabsets.js` and CSS `tabsets.css` to create tabsets
from sections (see [documentation
here](https://yihui.org/en/2023/10/section-tabsets/)).

``` yaml
css: ["@npm/@xiee/utils/js/tabsets.min.css"]
js: ["@npm/@xiee/utils/js/tabsets.min.js"]
```

#### Code folding

Code folding can be supported by `fold-details.js` (see [documentation
here](https://yihui.org/en/2023/09/code-folding/)).

``` yaml
js: ["@npm/@xiee/utils/js/fold-details.min.js"]
```

#### Right-align a quote footer

You can use the script `right-quote.js` to right-align a blockquote footer if it
starts with an em-dash (`---`).

``` yaml
js: ["@npm/@xiee/utils/js/right-quote.min.js"]
```

#### Add anchor links to headings

The CSS is necessary only if you want to hide the anchors by default and reveal
them on hover.

``` yaml
css: ["default", "@npm/@xiee/utils/css/heading-anchor.min.css"]
js: ["@npm/@xiee/utils/js/heading-anchor.min.js"]
```

#### Style keyboard shortcuts

The script `key-button.js` identifies keys and the CSS styles them, which can be
useful for [showing keyboard
shortcuts](https://yihui.org/en/2023/02/key-buttons/).

``` yaml
css: ["default", "@npm/@xiee/utils/css/key-buttons.min.css"]
js: ["@npm/@xiee/utils/js/key-buttons.min.js"]
```

Of course, you can combine any number of JS scripts and CSS files if you want
multiple features.

## Using RStudio

If you use the RStudio IDE, the `Knit` button can render your Markdown or R
Markdown document to the `output` format specified in YAML (e.g.,
`markdown::html_format` or `markdown::latex_format`). This requires the
**\*r\*markdown** package (\>= v2.18), although the **markdown** package itself
doesn't really require **rmarkdown**.

If you only need to render a document to the HTML format, you can bypass
RStudio's requirement for **rmarkdown**:

-   Insert an HTML comment `<!-- rmarkdown v1 -->` to your document (anywhere in
    the body after YAML).

-   Set an option in your `.Rprofile`:

    ``` r
    file.edit('~/.Rprofile')
    options(rstudio.markdownToHTML = function(...) {
      markdown::mark_html(...)
    })
    ```

Then restart R, and you will be able to use the `Knit` button to render your (R)
Markdown document with the **markdown** package alone.

Since the Markdown syntax of **markdown** can be viewed as a small and strict
subset of Pandoc's Markdown, you can use RStudio's visual Markdown editor to
author documents. Please bear in mind that most common, but not all, Markdown
features are supported.

## Appendix {.appendix}

## For rmarkdown Users

The **markdown** package has also provided two *internal* output formats for
compatibility with **rmarkdown**: `markdown:::html_document` and
`markdown:::pdf_document`.[^4] The purpose is to make it a little easier to
switch from **rmarkdown** to **markdown** by mapping some **rmarkdown** output
format options to **markdown**.

[^4]: The triple-colon `:::` means these functions are not exported, which is to
    avoid name conflicts between the two packages.

For example, for an R Markdown document with the following output format:

``` yaml
output:
  rmarkdown::html_document:
    toc: true
    number_sections: true
    anchor_sections: true
    self_contained: false
```

You can switch to **markdown** simply by changing the output format name from
`rmarkdown::html_document` to `markdown:::html_document`. Internally, the above
output format is transformed to:

``` yaml
output:
  markdown::html_format:
    options:
      toc: true
      number_sections: true
      embed_resources: false
    meta:
      css: ["default", "@npm/@xiee/utils/css/heading-anchor.min.css"]
      js: ["@npm/@xiee/utils/js/heading-anchor.min.js"]
```

Note that not all **rmarkdown** options are supported, and not even all
supported options have exactly the same effects in **markdown**. The supported
options include:
`r knitr::combine_words(setdiff(names(formals(markdown:::map_args)), '...'), before='\u60')`.

## Technical Notes

### Embedding resources

When `https` resources needs to be embedded (via the `embed_resources` option),
only these elements are considered:

``` html
<img src="..." />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="...">
<script src="..."></script>
```

Background images set in the attribute `style="background-image: url(...)"` are
also considered. If an external CSS file contains `url()` resources, these
resources will also be downloaded and embedded.

<p>The <strong>markdown</strong> package is built on top of <strong>commonmark</strong>. It renders Markdown
to output formats supported by <strong>commonmark</strong>, and the primary output formats
are HTML and LaTeX.</p>
<p>Historically, it uses a C library named <strong>sundown</strong>, which has been deleted and
replaced by <strong>commonmark</strong> since v1.3 (2022-10-30). The main advantage of the
latter is that it follows a clear and widely used spec, i.e., GFM (<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub
Flavored Markdown</a>), which can be seen as a
subset of <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown">Pandoc‚Äôs Markdown</a>.
Therefore the <strong>markdown</strong> package can be viewed as a small subset of the
<strong>rmarkdown</strong> package (the latter is based on Pandoc but the former doesn‚Äôt
depend on external tools). It aims at simplicity, lightweight, and speed, at the
cost of giving up a lot of features. This package is intended for minimalists.
Most users may want to use tools based on Pandoc instead, such as <strong>rmarkdown</strong>
or Quarto.</p>
<h2 id="markdown-syntax"><span class="section-number">1.</span> Markdown Syntax</h2>
<h3 id="basic-syntax"><span class="section-number">1.1</span> Basic syntax</h3>
<p>For the full list of supported document elements, please read the GFM spec.
Below is a quick summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Headings start with a number of <code>#</code>‚Äôs, e.g., <code>## level-two heading</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inline elements: <code>**strong**</code>, <code>_emphasis_</code>, <code>~~strikethrough~~</code>,
<code>[text](link)</code>, and <code>![alt](image/path)</code>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1" data-footnote-ref>1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inline code is written in a pair of backticks, e.g., <code>`code`</code>. Code
blocks can be indented, or fenced by <code>```</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>List items start with <code>-</code>, <code>+</code>, or <code>*</code>, e.g., <code>- item</code>. A task list item is
a regular list item with <code>[ ]</code> or <code>[x]</code> in the beginning, e.g.,
<code>- [ ] item</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Block quotes start with <code>&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tables are created with <code>|</code> as the column separator (i.e., Pandoc‚Äôs pipe
table, which can be generated by <code>knitr::kable(x, &quot;pipe&quot;)</code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="add-on-features"><span class="section-number">1.2</span> Add-on features</h3>
<p>In addition to GFM features, the <strong>markdown</strong> package also supports the
following features.</p>
<h4 id="raw-latex-html-blocks"><span class="section-number">1.2.1</span> Raw LaTeX/HTML blocks</h4>
<p>Raw LaTeX and HTML blocks can be written as fenced code blocks with language
names <code>=latex</code> (or <code>=tex</code>) and <code>=html</code>, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">```{=tex}
This only appears in \LaTeX{} output.
```
</code></pre>
<p>Raw LaTeX blocks will only appear in LaTeX output, and will be ignored in other
output formats. Similarly, raw HTML blocks will only appear in HTML output. One
exception is raw LaTeX blocks that are LaTeX math environments, which also work
for HTML output (see the next section).</p>
<h4 id="latex-math_1"><span class="section-number">1.2.2</span> LaTeX math</h4>
<p>You can write both <code>$inline$</code> and <code>$$display$$</code> LaTeX math, e.g.,
\(\sin^{2}(\theta)+\cos^{2}(\theta) = 1\)</p>
<p>$$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$</p>
<p>$$|x| = \begin{cases} x &amp;\text{if } x \geq 0 \\ -x &amp;\text{if } x &lt; 0 \end{cases}$$</p>
<p>LaTeX math environments are also supported, e.g., below are an <code>align</code>
environment and an <code>equation</code> environment:</p>
<p>
\begin{align}
a^{2}+b^{2} &amp; =  c^{2}\\
\sin^{2}(\theta)+\cos^{2}(\theta) &amp; =  1
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(a+b)^2 &amp;=(a+b)(a+b)\\
  &amp;=a^2+2ab+b^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}
</p>
<p>These math environments can be written in raw LaTeX blocks, and they work for
both LaTeX and HTML output, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">```{=latex}
\begin{align}
a^{2}+b^{2} &amp; =  c^{2}\\
\sin^{2}(\theta)+\cos^{2}(\theta) &amp; =  1

```
</code></pre>
<p>For HTML output, it is up to the JavaScript library (MathJax or KaTeX) whether a
math environment can be rendered.</p>
<h4 id="superscripts-and-subscripts"><span class="section-number">1.2.3</span> Superscripts and subscripts</h4>
<p>Write superscripts in <code>^text^</code> and subscripts in <code>~text~</code> (same syntax as
Pandoc‚Äôs Markdown), e.g., 2<sup>10</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O. Currently only alphanumeric
characters, <code>*</code>, <code>(</code>, and <code>)</code> are allowed in the scripts. For example, <code>a^b c^</code>
will not be recognized as a superscript (because the space is not allowed). Note
that GFM supports striking out text via <code>~text~</code>, but this feature has been
disabled and replaced by the feature of subscripts in <strong>markdown</strong>. To strike
out text, you must use a pair of <em>double</em> tildes.</p>
<h4 id="footnotes"><span class="section-number">1.2.4</span> Footnotes</h4>
<p>Insert footnotes via <code>[^n]</code>, where <code>n</code> is a footnote number (a unique
identifier). The footnote content should be defined in a separate block starting
with <code>[^n]:</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">Insert a footnote here.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote.
</code></pre>
<p>The support is limited for LaTeX output at the moment,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2" data-footnote-ref>2</a></sup> and there are two
caveats if the document is intended to be converted to LaTeX:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The footnote content must be a single paragraph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only numbers<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-3" id="fnref-3" data-footnote-ref>3</a></sup> are supported as identifiers, and other types of
identifiers are not recognized.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The two limitations do not apply to HTML output, e.g., you can write arbitrary
elements in footnotes and not necessarily one paragraph.</p>
<h4 id="attributes"><span class="section-number">1.2.5</span> Attributes</h4>
<p>Attributes on images, fenced code blocks, and section headings can be written in
<code>{}</code>. For example, <code>![text](path){.foo #bar width=&quot;50%&quot;}</code> will generate an
<code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag with attributes in HTML output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;img src=&quot;path&quot; alt=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;bar&quot; class=&quot;foo&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and <code>## Heading {#baz}</code> will generate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;baz&quot;&gt;Heading&lt;/h2&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>For fenced code blocks, a special rule is that the first class name will be
treated as the language name for a block, and the <code>class</code> attribute of the
result <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag will have a <code>language-</code> prefix. For example, the following
code block</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">```{.foo .bar #my-code style=&quot;color: red;&quot;}
```
</code></pre>
<p>will generate the HTML output below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;code class=&quot;language-foo bar&quot; id=&quot;my-code&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Most attributes in <code>{}</code> are ignored for LaTeX output except for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>width</code> attribute for images, e.g., <code>![text](path){width=&quot;50%&quot;}</code> will be
converted to <code>\includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{path}</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>.unnumbered</code> attribute, which will make a heading unnumbered, e.g.,
<code># Hello {.unnumbered}</code> will be converted to <code>\section*{Hello}</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>.appendix</code> attribute on a heading, which will start the appendix, e.g.,
<code># Appendix {.appendix}</code> will be converted to <code>\appendix</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="appendices"><span class="section-number">1.2.6</span> Appendices</h4>
<p>When a top-level heading has the attribute <code>.appendix</code>, the rest of the document
will be treated as the appendix. If <a href="#number-sections">section numbering</a> is
enabled, the appendix section headings will be numbered differently.</p>
<h4 id="fenced-divs"><span class="section-number">1.2.7</span> Fenced <code>Div</code>s</h4>
<p>A fenced <code>Div</code> can be written in <code>:::</code> fences. Note that the opening fence must
have at least one attribute, such as the class name. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">::: foo
This is a fenced Div.
:::

::: {.foo}
The syntax `::: foo` is equivalent to `::: {.foo}`.
:::

::: {.foo #bar style=&quot;color: red;&quot;}
This div has more attributes.

It will be red in HTML output.
:::
</code></pre>
<p>A fenced <code>Div</code> will be converted to <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with attributes in HTML output,
e.g.,</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class=&quot;foo&quot; id=&quot;bar&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>For LaTeX output, it can be converted to a LaTeX environment if both the class
name and an attribute <code>data-latex</code> are present. For example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">::: {.tiny data-latex=&quot;&quot;}
This is _tiny_ text.
:::
</code></pre>
<p>will be converted to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-latex">\begin{tiny}
This is \emph{tiny} text.
\end{tiny}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>data-latex</code> attribute can be used to specify arguments to the environment
(which can be an empty string if the environment doesn‚Äôt need an argument). For
example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">::: {.minipage data-latex=&quot;{.5\linewidth}&quot;}
</code></pre>
<p>will be converted to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-latex">\begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
</code></pre>
<p>If a fenced <code>Div</code> doesn‚Äôt have the <code>data-latex</code> attribute, the fence will be
ignored, and its content will be written out normally without a surrounding
environment. If a fenced <code>Div</code> has multiple class names (e.g., <code>{.a .b .c}</code>),
only the first class name will be used as the LaTeX environment name. However,
all class names will be used if the output format is HTML (e.g.,
<code>&lt;div class=&quot;a b c&quot;&gt;</code>).</p>
<h4 id="smart-html-entities"><span class="section-number">1.2.8</span> Smart HTML entities</h4>
<p>‚ÄúSmart‚Äù HTML entities can be represented by ASCII characters, e.g., you can
write fractions in the form <code>n/m</code>. Below are some example entities:</p>
<table>

<h3 id="comparison-to-pandoc"><span class="section-number">1.3</span> Comparison to Pandoc</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a lot of features in Pandoc‚Äôs Markdown are not supported
in the <strong>markdown</strong> package. Any feature that you find missing in previous
sections is likely to be unavailable, such as citations and figure/table
captions. In addition, a lot of R Markdown and Quarto (both are based on Pandoc)
features are not supported, either. Some HTML features may be implemented via
JavaScript, but currently it is not straightforward and may be improved in
future.</p>
<p>Pandoc can convert Markdown to many output formats, such as Word, PowerPoint,
LaTeX beamer, and EPUB. The <strong>markdown</strong> package is unlikely to support output
formats beyond HTML and LaTeX.</p>
<h2 id="markdown-rendering"><span class="section-number">2.</span> Markdown Rendering</h2>
<p>The main function to convert Markdown to other formats is <code>markdown::mark()</code>;
<code>mark_html()</code> and <code>mark_latex()</code> are simple wrapper functions for HTML and LaTeX
output, respectively. The function <code>mark()</code> generates a document fragment by
default, and the wrapper functions <code>mark_*()</code> generates full documents.</p>
<p>You can either call <code>markdown::mark()</code> to render a Markdown document
programmatically, or click the <code>Knit</code> button in RStudio to render a (Markdown or
R Markdown) document interactively. The latter requires you to specify the
output format in the <code>output</code> field in YAML metadata (see the section ‚Äú<a href="#yaml-metadata">YAML
metadata</a>‚Äù), e.g.,</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
output:
  markdown::html_format:
    options:
      js_math:
        package: &quot;katex&quot;
        version: &quot;0.16.4&quot;
      number_sections: true
      embed_resources: [&quot;local&quot;, &quot;https&quot;]
    meta:
      css: &quot;custom.css&quot;
---
</code></pre>
<h3 id="markdown-options"><span class="section-number">2.1</span> Markdown options</h3>
<p>The <code>options</code> argument of <code>mark()</code> can be used to enable/disable/set options to
control Markdown rendering. This argument can take either a list, e.g.,
<code>list(toc = TRUE, smart = FALSE)</code>, or a character vector, e.g.,
<code>c(&quot;+toc&quot;, &quot;-smart&quot;)</code>, or equivalently, <code>+toc-smart</code>, where <code>+</code> means to enable
an option, and <code>-</code> means to disable an option. The options can also be set in
<a href="#yaml-metadata">YAML metadata</a> (recommended). Available options are listed
below.</p>
<h4 id="auto-identifiers"><span class="section-number">2.1.1</span> <code>auto_identifiers</code></h4>
<p>Add automatic IDs to headings, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># Hello world!
</code></pre>
<p>will be converted to</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;hello-world&quot;&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You can override the automatic ID by providing an ID manually via the ID
attribute, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># Hello world! {#hello}
</code></pre>
<p>An automatic ID is generated by substituting non-alphanumeric characters in the
heading text with hyphens. If the result is empty, the ID will be <code>section</code>. If
any ID is duplicated, a numeric suffix will be added to the ID, e.g.,
<code>example_1</code> and <code>example_2</code>.</p>
<h4 id="embed-resources"><span class="section-number">2.1.2</span> <code>embed_resources</code></h4>
<p>Embed resources (images, CSS, and JS) in the HTML output using their
base64-encoded data (images) or raw content (CSS/JS). Possible values are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>null</code> or <code>false</code>: Do not embed any resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>&quot;local&quot;</code> or <code>true</code>: Embed local image/CSS/JS files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>&quot;https&quot;</code>: Embed web resources (links that start with <code>https://</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>&quot;all&quot;</code>: An alias to the union of <code>&quot;local&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;https&quot;</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The default is <code>&quot;local&quot;</code>, i.e., local resources are embedded, whereas <code>https</code>
resources are not. This means the output document may not work offline. If you
have to view the output offline, you need to use the option value <code>&quot;https&quot;</code> (or
<code>&quot;all&quot;</code>) and render the document at least once before you go offline.</p>
<h4 id="js-highlight"><span class="section-number">2.1.3</span> <code>js_highlight</code></h4>
<p>Specify the JavaScript library to syntax highlight code blocks. Possible values
are <code>highlight</code> (<a href="https://highlightjs.org">highlight.js</a>) and <code>prism</code>
(<a href="https://prismjs.com">Prism.js</a>). The default is <code>prism</code>. This option can also
take a list of the form <code>list(package, version, style, languages)</code>, which
specifies the package name (<code>highlight</code> or <code>prism</code>), version, CSS style/theme
name, and names of languages to be highlighted.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can find information about Prism.js from its CDN at
<a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prismjs/">https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prismjs/</a>. Available styles are under the
<code>themes/</code> directory (e.g., <code>prism-dark</code>), and languages are under the
<code>components/</code> directory (e.g., <code>prism-c</code>). You can omit the prefix <code>prism-</code>,
e.g.,</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">js_highlight:
  package: prism
  style: dark
  languages: [r, latex, yaml]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CDN of highlight.js is at
<a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release/build/">https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release/build/</a>. Themes are
under the <code>styles/</code> directory (e.g., <code>github</code>), and you can find demos of
themes at <a href="https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/">https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/</a>. Supported language are
under the <code>languages/</code> directory (e.g., <code>latex</code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, languages are automatically detected and the required JS files are
automatically loaded. Normally you need to specify the <code>languages</code> array only if
the automatic detection fails.</p>
<p>Technically this option is a shorthand for setting the <a href="#yaml-metadata">metadata
variables</a> <code>css</code> and <code>js</code>. If you want full control, you may
disable this option (set it to <code>false</code> or <code>null</code>) and use metadata variables
directly, which requires more familiarity with the JS libraries and the jsdelivr
CDN.</p>
<h4 id="js-math"><span class="section-number">2.1.4</span> <code>js_math</code></h4>
<p>Specify the JavaScript library for rendering math expressions in HTML output.
Possible values are <code>&quot;mathjax&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;katex&quot;</code> (the default). Like the
<code>js_highlight</code> option, this option is also essentially a shorthand for setting
the metadata variables <code>css</code> and <code>js</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted">MathJax</a>, the <code>js</code> variable is
set to <code>tex-mml-chtml.js</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For <a href="https://katex.org/docs/browser.html">KaTeX</a>, the <code>js</code> variable is set
to <code>katex.min.js</code> and the <code>css</code> variable is set to <code>katex.min.css</code>. KaTeX‚Äôs
<code>auto-render</code> extension (<code>auto-render.min.js</code>) is also enabled by default,
so math expressions can be immediately rendered when the page is loaded.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want finer control, you can provide a list of the form
<code>list(package, version, css, js)</code>. This will allow you to specify the package
name, version, and css/js files. For example, if you want to use MathJax‚Äôs
<code>tex-chtml.js</code> instead, you may set:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">js_math:
  package: mathjax
  version: 3
  js: es5/tex-chtml.js
</code></pre>
<p>By default, MathJax version 3 is used. If you want to use the older v2, you may
set:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">js_math:
  package: mathjax
  version: 2
  js: MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_CHTML
</code></pre>
<p>Please visit <a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax/">the MathJax CDN</a> to know
which versions and JS files are available.</p>
<p>For KaTeX, the version is not specified by default, which means the latest
version from <a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex/">the CDN</a>. Below is an example
of specifying the version 0.16.4 and using the <code>mhchem</code> extension:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">js_math:
  package: katex
  version: 0.16.4
  js: [dist/katex.min.js, dist/contrib/mhchem.min.js]
</code></pre>
<p>Note that if you want the HTML output to be self-contained via the
<code>embed_resources</code> option, KaTeX can be embedded and used offline, but MathJax
cannot be fully embedded due to its complexity. MathJax v3 can be partially
embedded and used offline, but currently only its fonts can be embedded, and
extensions cannot. If you must view HTML output offline, we recommend using
KaTeX, but please also note that KaTeX and MathJax do not fully cover each
other‚Äôs features.</p>
<h4 id="latex-math_2"><span class="section-number">2.1.5</span> <code>latex_math</code></h4>
<p>Whether to identify LaTeX math expressions in pairs of single (<code>$ $</code>) or double
dollar signs (<code>$$ $$</code>), and transform them so that they could be correctly
rendered by MathJax (HTML output) or LaTeX.</p>
<h4 id="number-sections"><span class="section-number">2.1.6</span> <code>number_sections</code></h4>
<p>Whether to number section headings. To skip numbering a specific heading, add an
attribute <code>{.unnumbered}</code> to it.</p>
<h4 id="smartypants"><span class="section-number">2.1.7</span> <code>smartypants</code></h4>
<p>Whether to translate certain ASCII strings into smart typographic characters
(see <code>?markdown::smartypants</code>).</p>
<h4 id="superscript"><span class="section-number">2.1.8</span> <code>superscript</code></h4>
<p>Whether to translate strings between two carets into superscripts, e.g.,
<code>text^foo^</code> to <code>text&lt;sup&gt;foo&lt;/sup&gt;</code>.</p>
<h4 id="subscript"><span class="section-number">2.1.9</span> <code>subscript</code></h4>
<p>Whether to translate strings between two tildes into subscripts, e.g.,
<code>text~foo~</code> to <code>text&lt;sub&gt;foo&lt;/sub&gt;</code>.</p>
<h4 id="toc"><span class="section-number">2.1.10</span> <code>toc</code></h4>
<p>Whether to generate a table of contents (TOC) from section headings. If a
heading has an <code>id</code> attribute, the corresponding TOC item will be a link to this
heading. You can also set a sub-option:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>depth</code>: The number of section levels to include in the TOC (<code>3</code> by
default). Setting <code>toc</code> to <code>true</code> is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">toc:
  depth: 3
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="top-level"><span class="section-number">2.1.11</span> <code>top_level</code></h4>
<p>The desired type of the top-level headings in LaTeX output. Possible values are
<code>'chapter'</code> and <code>'part'</code>. For example, if <code>top_level = 'chapter'</code>, <code># heading</code>
will be rendered to <code>\chapter{heading}</code> instead of the default
<code>\section{heading}</code>.</p>
<p>Options not described above can be found on the help pages of <strong>commonmark</strong>,
e.g., the <code>hardbreaks</code> option is for the <code>hardbreaks</code> argument of
<code>commonmark::markdown_*()</code> functions, and the <code>table</code> option is for the <code>table</code>
extension in <strong>commonmark</strong>‚Äôs extensions.</p>

<h3 id="templates"><span class="section-number">2.2</span> Templates</h3>
<p>By default, <code>mark()</code> generates a document fragment (i.e., the body). To generate
a full document, you need a template. Below is a simple HTML template example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;$title$&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
  $body$
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It contains two variables, <code>$title$</code> and <code>$body$</code>. All variables will be
substituted by metadata values, except for <code>$body$</code>, which takes the value from
<code>mark()</code>.</p>
<p>The <strong>markdown</strong> has provided default templates for
<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/markdown/blob/master/inst/resources/markdown.html">HTML</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/markdown/blob/master/inst/resources/markdown.latex">LaTeX</a>
output. To use them, call <code>mark(..., template = TRUE)</code>, or the wrapper functions
<code>mark_html()</code> / <code>mark_latex()</code>. To pass metadata to templates, use the <code>meta</code>
argument, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">markdown::mark(..., meta = list(title = &quot;My Title&quot;), template = TRUE)
</code></pre>
<p>You can provide your own template file to the <code>template</code> argument, too.</p>
<h3 id="yaml-metadata"><span class="section-number">2.3</span> YAML metadata</h3>
<p>Alternatively, the <code>meta</code> argument can read YAML metadata in the Markdown
document. The following variables can be set in the top-level fields in YAML:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>author</code>: The document author(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>date</code>: The date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>title</code>: The document title.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
title: &quot;My Title&quot;
author: &quot;[Frida Gomam](https://example.com)&quot;
date: &quot;2023-01-09&quot;
---
</code></pre>
<p>Note that you can use Markdown syntax in them.</p>
<p>Other variables need to be specified under
<code>output -&gt; markdown::*_format -&gt; meta</code>, where <code>*</code> can be <code>html</code> or <code>latex</code>,
e.g.,</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
title: &quot;My Title&quot;
output:
  markdown::html_format:
    meta:
      css: &quot;style.css&quot;
      js: &quot;script.js&quot;
  markdown::latex_format:
    meta:
      documentclass: &quot;book&quot;
      header_includes: &quot;\\usepackage{microtype}&quot;
---
</code></pre>
<p>The following metadata variables are supported for both HTML and LaTeX
templates:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>header-includes</code>, <code>include-before</code>, <code>include-after</code>: Either a vector of
(HTML/LaTeX) code or a code file to be included in the header, before the
body, or after the body of the output.</li>
</ul>
<p>Variables specific to the HTML template:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>css</code>: A vector of CSS files to be included in the output. The default value
is <code>markdown:::pkg_file('resources', 'default.css')</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to use built-in CSS files in this package, you can only specify
the base name, e.g., <code>default</code> means <code>default.css</code> in this package.</p>
<p>You can also use web resources, e.g., <code>https://example.org/style.css</code>. One
special case is <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com">jsdelivr</a> resources: if a <code>css</code>
value starts with <code>@</code>, it will be recognized as a jsdelivr.com resource. if
you are not familiar with jsdelivr, you may read its documentation to
understand the following example URLs. The shorthand syntax is as follows
(<code>...</code> stands for <code>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>@foo</code> will be converted to
<code>.../gh/rstudio/markdown/inst/resources/foo</code>, e.g., <code>@default</code> means
<code>.../gh/rstudio/markdown/inst/resources/default.css</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>@path/to/file</code> (i.e., a value that contains slashes) will be converted
to <code>.../path/to/file</code>, e.g., <code>@npm/@xiee/utils/js/center-img.js</code> will be
converted to <code>.../npm/@xiee/utils/js/center-img.min.js</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>@path/to/file-1,file-2</code> (comma-separated values and later values do not
contain slashes) will be converted to
<code>.../combine/path/to/file-1,path/to/file-2</code> (this can be useful to
<a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/documentation#id-combine-multiple-files">combine</a>
multiple resources and load all at once).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>@path-1/to/file-1,path-2/to/file-2</code> (comma-separated values and later
values contain slashes) will be converted to
<code>.../combine/path-1/to/file-1,path-2/to/file-2</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This provides a way to reduce the output HTML file size by loading CSS from
the web instead of embedding inside HTML, at the cost of requiring Internet
connection when viewing the HTML file. If you need the external web
resources to work after you go offline, you can enable <code>&quot;https&quot;</code> in the
Markdown option <code>embed_resources</code> in advance to embed the resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>js</code>: A vector of JavaScript files to be included in the output. The syntax
is the same as the <code>css</code> variable, e.g., <code>snap</code> means <code>snap.js</code> in this
package, and <code>@snap</code> means a ‚Äújsdelivr‚Äù resource.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Variables specific to the LaTeX template:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>classoption</code>: A string containing options for the document class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>documentclass</code>: The document class (by default, <code>article</code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can use either underscores or hyphens in the variable names.
Underscores will be normalized to hyphens internally, e.g., <code>header_includes</code>
will be converted to <code>header-includes</code>. This means if you use a custom template,
you must use hyphens instead of underscores as separators in variable names in
the template.</p>
<p>The above are variables supported in the default templates. If you use a custom
template, you can use arbitrary variable names consisting of alphanumeric
characters and hyphens, except for <code>$body$</code> (which is a reserved name), and your
metadata values will be passed to these variables in your template.</p>
<p>Besides metadata variables, the aforementioned Markdown options can also be set
in YAML under <code>output -&gt; markdown::*_format -&gt; options</code>, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">output:
  markdown::html_format:
    options:
      toc: true
      js_highlight:
        package: highlight
        theme: github
        languages: [diff, latex]
</code></pre>
<p>See the help page <code>?markdown::html_format</code> for possible fields in addiction to
<code>meta</code> and <code>options</code> that can be specified under the format name, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">output:
  markdown::latex_format:
    latex_engine: xelatex
    keep_md: true
    template: custom-template.tex
</code></pre>
<h2 id="applications"><span class="section-number">3.</span> Applications</h2>
<p>The <strong>markdown</strong> package aims at lightweight with a minimal number of features.
You can build lightweight applications on top of it. In this section, we
introduce some example applications.</p>
<h3 id="html-slides"><span class="section-number">3.1</span> HTML slides</h3>
<p>With an extra CSS file and a JS file, you can create lightweight HTML slides:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">---
output:
  markdown::html_format:
    meta:
      css: [default, slides]
      js: [slides]
---
</code></pre>
<p>You can learn more in <a href="slides.html"><code>vignette('slides', package = 'markdown')</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="html-articles"><span class="section-number">3.2</span> HTML articles</h3>
<p>Similarly, you can write an HTML article with extra CSS and JS. Learn more about
it in <a href="article.html"><code>vignette('article', package = 'markdown')</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="external-js-css"><span class="section-number">3.3</span> External JS/CSS</h3>
<p>You can load arbitrary external JS and CSS files via the <code>js</code> and <code>css</code>
variables. There are numerous JS libraries and CSS frameworks on the web. Here
we will only use the JS/CSS from the repo <a href="https://github.com/yihui/misc.js">https://github.com/yihui/misc.js</a> to
show a few brief examples.</p>
<h4 id="tabbed-sections"><span class="section-number">3.3.1</span> Tabbed sections</h4>
<p>You can load the script <code>tabsets.js</code> and CSS <code>tabsets.css</code> to create tabsets
from sections (see <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2023/10/section-tabsets/">documentation
here</a>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">css: [&quot;@npm/@xiee/utils/js/tabsets.min.css&quot;]
js: [&quot;@npm/@xiee/utils/js/tabsets.min.js&quot;]
</code></pre>
<h4 id="code-folding"><span class="section-number">3.3.2</span> Code folding</h4>
<p>Code folding can be supported by <code>fold-details.js</code> (see <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2023/09/code-folding/">documentation
here</a>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">js: [&quot;@npm/@xiee/utils/js/fold-details.min.js&quot;]
</code></pre>
<h4 id="right-align-a-quote-footer"><span class="section-number">3.3.3</span> Right-align a quote footer</h4>
<p>You can use the script <code>right-quote.js</code> to right-align a blockquote footer if it
starts with an em-dash (<code>---</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">js: [&quot;@npm/@xiee/utils/js/right-quote.min.js&quot;]
</code></pre>
<h4 id="add-anchor-links-to-headings"><span class="section-number">3.3.4</span> Add anchor links to headings</h4>
<p>The CSS is necessary only if you want to hide the anchors by default and reveal
them on hover.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">css: [&quot;default&quot;, &quot;@npm/@xiee/utils/css/heading-anchor.min.css&quot;]
js: [&quot;@npm/@xiee/utils/js/heading-anchor.min.js&quot;]
</code></pre>
<h4 id="style-keyboard-shortcuts"><span class="section-number">3.3.5</span> Style keyboard shortcuts</h4>
<p>The script <code>key-button.js</code> identifies keys and the CSS styles them, which can be
useful for <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2023/02/key-buttons/">showing keyboard
shortcuts</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">css: [&quot;default&quot;, &quot;@npm/@xiee/utils/css/key-buttons.min.css&quot;]
js: [&quot;@npm/@xiee/utils/js/key-buttons.min.js&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you can combine any number of JS scripts and CSS files if you want
multiple features.</p>
<h2 id="using-rstudio"><span class="section-number">4.</span> Using RStudio</h2>
<p>If you use the RStudio IDE, the <code>Knit</code> button can render your Markdown or R
Markdown document to the <code>output</code> format specified in YAML (e.g.,
<code>markdown::html_format</code> or <code>markdown::latex_format</code>). This requires the
<strong>*r*markdown</strong> package (&gt;= v2.18), although the <strong>markdown</strong> package itself
doesn‚Äôt really require <strong>rmarkdown</strong>.</p>
<p>If you only need to render a document to the HTML format, you can bypass
RStudio‚Äôs requirement for <strong>rmarkdown</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Insert an HTML comment <code>&lt;!-- rmarkdown v1 --&gt;</code> to your document (anywhere in
the body after YAML).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set an option in your <code>.Rprofile</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">file.edit('~/.Rprofile')
options(rstudio.markdownToHTML = function(...) {
  markdown::mark_html(...)
})
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then restart R, and you will be able to use the <code>Knit</code> button to render your (R)
Markdown document with the <strong>markdown</strong> package alone.</p>
<p>Since the Markdown syntax of <strong>markdown</strong> can be viewed as a small and strict
subset of Pandoc‚Äôs Markdown, you can use RStudio‚Äôs visual Markdown editor to
author documents. Please bear in mind that most common, but not all, Markdown
features are supported.</p>
<h2 id="appendix" class="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<h2 id="for-rmarkdown-users"><span class="section-number">A.</span> For rmarkdown Users</h2>
<p>The <strong>markdown</strong> package has also provided two <em>internal</em> output formats for
compatibility with <strong>rmarkdown</strong>: <code>markdown:::html_document</code> and
<code>markdown:::pdf_document</code>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-4" id="fnref-4" data-footnote-ref>4</a></sup> The purpose is to make it a little easier to
switch from <strong>rmarkdown</strong> to <strong>markdown</strong> by mapping some <strong>rmarkdown</strong> output
format options to <strong>markdown</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, for an R Markdown document with the following output format:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">output:
  rmarkdown::html_document:
    toc: true
    number_sections: true
    anchor_sections: true
    self_contained: false
</code></pre>
<p>You can switch to <strong>markdown</strong> simply by changing the output format name from
<code>rmarkdown::html_document</code> to <code>markdown:::html_document</code>. Internally, the above
output format is transformed to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">output:
  markdown::html_format:
    options:
      toc: true
      number_sections: true
      embed_resources: false
    meta:
      css: [&quot;default&quot;, &quot;@npm/@xiee/utils/css/heading-anchor.min.css&quot;]
      js: [&quot;@npm/@xiee/utils/js/heading-anchor.min.js&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Note that not all <strong>rmarkdown</strong> options are supported, and not even all
supported options have exactly the same effects in <strong>markdown</strong>. The supported
options include:
<code>toc</code>, <code>toc_depth</code>, <code>number_sections</code>, <code>anchor_sections</code>, <code>code_folding</code>, <code>self_contained</code>, <code>math_method</code>, <code>css</code>, and <code>includes</code>.</p>
<h2 id="technical-notes"><span class="section-number">B.</span> Technical Notes</h2>
<h3 id="embedding-resources"><span class="section-number">B.1</span> Embedding resources</h3>
<p>When <code>https</code> resources needs to be embedded (via the <code>embed_resources</code> option),
only these elements are considered:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;img src=&quot;...&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;...&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Background images set in the attribute <code>style=&quot;background-image: url(...)&quot;</code> are
also considered. If an external CSS file contains <code>url()</code> resources, these
resources will also be downloaded and embedded.</p>
<section class="footnotes" data-footnotes>
<ol>
<li id="fn-1">
<p>Please note that for links and images, their URLs <a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/current/#link-destination">should not contain
spaces</a>. If they do,
the URLs must be enclosed in <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, e.g.,
<code>![alt](&lt;some dir/a subdir/foo.png&gt;).</code> <a href="#fnref-1" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref data-footnote-backref-idx="1" aria-label="Back to reference 1">‚Ü©</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-2">
<p>If you know C, I‚Äôll truly appreciate it if you could help with the LaTeX
implementation in GFM: <a href="https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/issues/314">https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/issues/314</a> <a href="#fnref-2" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref data-footnote-backref-idx="2" aria-label="Back to reference 2">‚Ü©</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-3">
<p>The specific number doesn‚Äôt matter, as long as it‚Äôs a unique footnote
number in the document. For example, the first footnote can be <code>[^100]</code> and
the second can be <code>[^64]</code>. Eventually they will appear as <code>[1]</code> and <code>[2]</code>.
If you use the RStudio visual editor to edit Markdown documents, the
footnote numbers will be automatically generated and updated when new
footnotes are inserted before existing footnotes. <a href="#fnref-3" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref data-footnote-backref-idx="3" aria-label="Back to reference 3">‚Ü©</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-4">
<p>The triple-colon <code>:::</code> means these functions are not exported, which is to
avoid name conflicts between the two packages. <a href="#fnref-4" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref data-footnote-backref-idx="4" aria-label="Back to reference 4">‚Ü©</a></p>

title: Making HTML Slides with the **markdown** Package
author: "[Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org)"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output:
  markdown::html_format:
    meta:
      css: [default, snap, "@npm/@xiee/utils/css/key-buttons.min.css,heading-anchor.min.css"]
      js: [snap, "@npm/@xiee/utils/js/key-buttons.min.js,external-link.min.js,heading-anchor.min.js"]
    options:
      toc: true
      number_sections: true
---

```{=html}
<!--
%\VignetteEngine{knitr::knitr}
%\VignetteIndexEntry{Making HTML Slides with the markdown Package}
%\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}
-->
```
## Get started

Specify at least one CSS file (`snap.css`) and one JS script (`snap.js`) in YAML
metadata:

``` yaml
---
output:
  markdown::html_format:
    meta:
      css: [default, slides]  # "slides" is an alias of "snap.css"
      js: [slides]  # "slides" is an alias of "snap.js"
---
```

You will learn more about `snap.css` and `snap.js` at the end of this
presentation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<!--# class="fade" -->

Equivalently, you can specify them in the arguments of `markdown::mark_html()`:

``` r
markdown::mark_html("test.md", output = "test.html", meta = list(
  css = c("default", "slides"),
  js = "slides"
))
```

but I recommend that you specify these options in YAML metadata instead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Create slides

There are two ways to create a new slide:

1.  Insert a horizontal rule (`---`).
2.  Or use the level-two section heading (`##`).

You must choose only one way, i.e., either use horizontal rules to separate all
slides, or avoid horizontal rules but only use section headings.

The first way is more flexible---you don't have to start a slide with a section
heading.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example (`---`)

``` markdown
## First slide

**Content**.

---

More _content_ on the next page.

---

## Third slide
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example (`##`)

``` markdown
## First slide

Content.

## Second slide

Content.

## Third slide
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Keyboard shortcuts

-   <kbd>f</kbd>: Fullscreen mode (press `Esc` to exit). The scroll bar will be
    hidden in the fullscreen mode. You can also use the keyboard shortcut of
    your browser, e.g., `fn + F` in Chrome on macOS.

-   <kbd>o</kbd>: Overview mode

    -   Slides become thumbnails, to make it easier to glance over multiple
        slides at once.

    -   Press <kbd>o</kbd> again to go back to presentation mode.

    -   Alternatively, you can click on a slide while holding the `Alt` key to
        toggle the overview mode and navigate to the clicked slide. Basically,
        `Alt + Click` is like zoom in/out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   <kbd>m</kbd>: Mirror mode

    -   Slides are mirrored.[^1]

    -   Press <kbd>m</kbd> again to resume.

[^1]: See [this post](https://yihui.org/en/2020/04/xaringan-mirror/) for a
    possible application of this odd feature.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS and styling

You can pass more CSS files to the `css` option, e.g., if you have `extra.css`
under the same directory as the Markdown input file:

``` yaml
---
output:
  markdown::html_format:
    meta:
      css: [default, slides, extra.css]
      js: [slides]
---
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your input document is `.Rmd`, you can also embed CSS directly in a `css`
code chunk:

````{verbatim, lang='markdown'}
```{css, echo=FALSE}
/* your CSS rules */
```
````

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a CSS code chunk in which we defined the font families for this
presentation:

```{css}
body {
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
}
.slide h1, .slide h2 {
  font-family: Baskerville, Garamond, serif;
}
code {
  font-family: Consolas, "Andale Mono", monospace;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example: section numbers

When the Markdown option `number_sections` is enabled, all sections are
numbered. You can hide all numbers via CSS:

```{css}
.section-number { display: none; }
```

For this presentation, only section numbers for level-two headings are
displayed:

```{css}
#TOC > ul > li > .section-number,
h2 > .section-number {
  display: inline-block;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example: TOC

If you enable the table of contents (TOC) by setting the option `toc: true`, you
will get a TOC slide after the title slide. It uses a two-column layout by
default. You can custom its styles via the CSS selector `#TOC`. For example, you
can use three columns:

``` css
#TOC { columns: 3; }
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Or define the TOC title by:

```{css}
#TOC::before { content: "Outline"; }
```

Or shorten TOC (hide lower-level headings):

``` css
#TOC li ul { display: none; }
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this presentation, we don't hide lower-level headings in TOC but just make
them more compact (`display: inline;`):

```{css}
#TOC li ul li {
  display: inline;
  border-left: 0.2em dotted #ccc;
  padding-left: 0.2em;
}
#TOC li ul li a {
  color: #666;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Responsive layout

| Media               | Width    |  Mode   | Font size | Overview columns |
|---------------------|----------|:-------:|:---------:|:----------------:|
| Super large devices | ‚â• 1800px |    ‚Üì    |     ‚Üì     |        4         |
| Larger desktops     | ‚â• 1400px |    ‚Üì    |     ‚Üì     |        3         |
| Desktops            | ‚â• 992px  | Slides  |   200%    |        2         |
| Phones and tablets  | \< 992px | Article |   100%    |       N/A        |

You can resize your browser window to see the effect (also try to press
<kbd>o</kbd> and test the overview mode). If you are on a mobile device, you
should see a normal continuous page, since you cannot adjust the window size.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Printing

-   When the slides are printed, the font size will be reduced.

-   To save space, the presentation is printed as a *continuous* document
    instead of slides.

-   If you want borders on slides, print them from the overview mode.

-   To customize style for printing, you may define CSS rules in:

    ``` css
    @media print {
    }
    ```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Slide attributes

You can add more attributes to a slide via an HTML comment that starts with `#`
(`Cmd / Ctrl + Shift + C` in RStudio's visual Markdown editor), e.g.,

``` html
<!--# class="inverse" style="color: red;"
contenteditable -->
```

The syntax is just HTML. These attributes will be added to the slide container:

``` html
<div class="slide inverse" style="color: red;" contenteditable>
</div>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Built-in classes

-   `inverse`: Apply a dark background and invert the slide color.

-   `center`: Center all elements horizontally.

-   `middle`: Center all elements vertically.

-   `fade`: Fade a slide (50% opacity) and apply grid lines to the background
    (can be useful for de-emphasizing a slide).

You can define your own arbitrary class names (e.g., `<!--# class="large" -->`)
and corresponding CSS rules (e.g., `.large { font-size: 150%; }`).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example: an inverse slide

<!--# class="inverse" style="font-size: 130%;" -->

``` html
<!--# class="inverse" style="font-size: 130%;" -->
```

-   The background is (nearly) black and the text is white.

-   The font size is 30% larger.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example: center content

<!--# class="middle center" -->

Everything is centered both vertically and horizontally.

``` html
<!--# class="middle center" -->
```

Of course, you don't have to use both classes at the same time. Depending on how
you want to center content, you can use one of these classes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example: fade a slide

<!--# class="fade" -->

``` html
<!--# class="fade" -->
```

This slide is not important. You do not need to read it carefully. You can even
take a nap, since the speaker is boring.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example: a background image

<!--# style="background-image: url(https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/219277796-6d2dd826-fb11-4970-b07c-dd920a694e3b.jpg); background-size: cover; color: lightgreen;" -->

``` html
<!--#
style="background-image: url(path/to/image);"
-->
```

We use the `style` attribute to introduce a background image to this slide. You
can learn more about the `background-image` property
[here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.php).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example: an editable slide

<!--# contenteditable style="font-family: fantasy, monospace;" -->

``` html
<!--# contenteditable -->
```

Believe it or not, this slide is editable because we have enabled the
`contenteditable` attribute. If you find any mistake on your slide during your
presentation, you can click on it and edit any text.

Note that your edits *will not* be saved, though.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Miscellaneous elements

### Page numbers

They are placed in `<span class="page-number"></span>` at the bottom right of
all slides.

If you click on a page number, the URL of the presentation will be appended by a
hash of the form `#N`, where `N` is the page number. You can share this URL with
other people when you want to point them to a specific page in the slides.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Timer

A timer is added to the bottom left in `<span class="timer"></span>` by default.
If you want a *countdown* timer, you can add a custom `<span>` to your document
(in Markdown, you can use a raw HTML block ```` ```{=html} ````), and specify
the total number of seconds in the attribute `data-total`, e.g.,

``` html
<span class="timer" data-total="1200"></span>
```

The timer will start when the presentation becomes fullscreen. To restart the
timer, click on it.

For the countdown timer, when the time is up, the timer will start to blink.

```{=html}
<span class="timer" data-total="1200"></span>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Caveats

### Lengthy slides

<!--# class="extend" -->

When the height of a slide exceeds the window height, you need to be careful
because it can be easy to accidentally scroll to the next page as you approach
the bottom of the slide.

One solution is to add more space to the bottom of the slide using the `extend`
class.

``` html
<!--# class="extend" -->
```

This will add a placeholder with the class `spacer` to the end of the slide.
This placeholder has a height of `50vh`, i.e., half of the window height (you
can customize it via CSS). That means as soon as the bottom of the slide reaches
the middle of the screen, you will be navigated to the next slide. Be careful!
If you move from an oversized slide to the next slide by accident, you *will
not* be able to move back to the bottom of the previous slide directly! Instead,
you will always be navigated to the top of the previous slide if you want to go
back. When you are on a long slide, I recommend that you use your mouse wheel or
the `Down` arrow key to scroll at small steps, instead of using the `PageDown`
key to scroll over to the next screen at once.

Because of this hassle, you may not really want to make a slide lengthy, but it
may be unavoidable when you have lengthy content to show on one slide and it
cannot be broken. Below is a toy example (the output block cannot be split onto
two slides):

```{r, comment=''}
cat(1:10, sep = "\n")
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Aspect ratio

<!--# class="extend" -->

The aspect ratio of slides is not defined by default. The content will fit all
available space on the screen. If you present the slides directly with your own
computer, this may not be a problem since you know if all content fits well on
your own screen. However, if you connect your computer to a projector or present
the slides on another computer, you'd better know the screen resolution
beforehand, because the aspect ratio may be different, and your slides can look
different on that screen.

You can fix the aspect ratio by setting the body width in CSS. For example, if
your computer screen's resolution is 900 √ó 1440, and you want the aspect ratio
4:3, you should set the body width to 1200px (= 900 √ó 4/3).

``` css
body { width: 1200px; }
```

Or set the width to a proportion of the height. A relative value will work with
any screen height, e.g., 4/3 ‚âà 1.33:

``` css
body { width: 133vh; }
```

However, note that when the presentation is not fullscreen, the slides will not
take the full screen height (the browser UI elements such as the menu and tool
bar will take some vertical space), so `133vh` will be an underestimate of the
width.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical notes

How does this HTML presentation work under the hood?

### The original HTML

``` html
<h2>First slide</h2>
<p>Content</p>
<hr>
<h2>Second slide</h2>
<p>More content</p>
<hr>
```

This can be generated from Markdown.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### snap.js

The script
[`snap.js`](https://github.com/rstudio/markdown/blob/master/inst/resources/snap.js)
converts HTML to a structure more convenient to style as slides:

``` html
<div class="slide-container">
  <div class="slide">
    <h2>First slide</h2>
    <p>Content</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
    <h2>Second slide</h2>
    <p>More content</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### snap.css

The core technique is [CSS Scroll
Snap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scroll_Snap/Basic_concepts).
The full CSS is
[`snap.css`](https://github.com/rstudio/markdown/blob/master/inst/resources/snap.css),
and the essential rules are:

``` css
html {
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
}
.slide {
  min-height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-align: start;
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The JS and CSS code can be used outside the R package **markdown**, too. You
just need to have the correct HTML structure. Then in your HTML document:

``` html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rstudio/markdown@VERSION/inst/resources/snap.min.js" defer></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/combine/gh/rstudio/markdown@VERSION/inst/resources/default.min.css,gh/rstudio/markdown@VERSION/inst/resources/snap.min.css">
```

Remember to substitute `VERSION` with [an appropriate
version](https://github.com/rstudio/markdown/tags) (e.g., `1.11`). You can omit
`@VERSION` to use the latest version but it is not recommended because future
updates might break your old slides.

Both the JS and CSS are quite lightweight (total size is
`r xfun::format_bytes(sum(file.size(pres_files <- markdown:::pkg_file('resources', c('default.css', 'snap.css', 'snap.js')))))`
when uncompressed) and have no dependencies. They were written from scratch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Enjoy!

-   I developed the [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) in package
    2016 and have used it since then. It still works perfectly, but now I prefer
    more lightweight frameworks.

-   Most of presentation features that I need are included in
    `r length(xfun::read_all(pres_files))` lines of JS/CSS code (`default.css` /
    `snap.js` / `snap.css`).

-   This simple presentation framework is highly customizable. Customizing
    slides can be addictive if you know HTML/CSS/JS.

-   Learn more about the Markdown syntax in
    [`vignette('intro', package = 'markdown')`](intro.html).

<p>There are two ways to create a new slide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Insert a horizontal rule (<code>---</code>).</li>
<li>Or use the level-two section heading (<code>##</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>You must choose only one way, i.e., either use horizontal rules to separate all
slides, or avoid horizontal rules but only use section headings.</p>
<p>The first way is more flexible‚Äîyou don‚Äôt have to start a slide with a section

<p>If your input document is <code>.Rmd</code>, you can also embed CSS directly in a <code>css</code>
code chunk:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">```{css, echo=FALSE}
/* your CSS rules */

</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>Below is a CSS code chunk in which we defined the font families for this
presentation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">body {
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
}
.slide h1, .slide h2 {
  font-family: Baskerville, Garamond, serif;
}
code {
  font-family: Consolas, &quot;Andale Mono&quot;, monospace;
  font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>
<style type="text/css">
body {
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
}
.slide h1, .slide h2 {
  font-family: Baskerville, Garamond, serif;
}
code {
  font-family: Consolas, "Andale Mono", monospace;
  font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
<hr />
<h3 id="example-section-numbers"><span class="section-number">4.1</span> Example: section numbers</h3>
<p>When the Markdown option <code>number_sections</code> is enabled, all sections are
numbered. You can hide all numbers via CSS:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.section-number { display: none; }
</code></pre>
<style type="text/css">
.section-number { display: none; }
</style>
<p>For this presentation, only section numbers for level-two headings are
displayed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">#TOC &gt; ul &gt; li &gt; .section-number,
h2 &gt; .section-number {
  display: inline-block;
}
</code></pre>
<style type="text/css">
#TOC > ul > li > .section-number,
h2 > .section-number {
  display: inline-block;
}
</style>
<hr />
<h3 id="example-toc"><span class="section-number">4.2</span> Example: TOC</h3>
<p>If you enable the table of contents (TOC) by setting the option <code>toc: true</code>, you
will get a TOC slide after the title slide. It uses a two-column layout by
default. You can custom its styles via the CSS selector <code>#TOC</code>. For example, you
can use three columns:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">#TOC { columns: 3; }
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>Or define the TOC title by:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">#TOC::before { content: &quot;Outline&quot;; }
</code></pre>
<style type="text/css">
#TOC::before { content: "Outline"; }
</style>
<p>Or shorten TOC (hide lower-level headings):</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">#TOC li ul { display: none; }
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>For this presentation, we don‚Äôt hide lower-level headings in TOC but just make
them more compact (<code>display: inline;</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">#TOC li ul li {
  display: inline;
  border-left: 0.2em dotted #ccc;
  padding-left: 0.2em;
}
#TOC li ul li a {

<hr />
<h3 id="printing"><span class="section-number">4.4</span> Printing</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the slides are printed, the font size will be reduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To save space, the presentation is printed as a <em>continuous</em> document
instead of slides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want borders on slides, print them from the overview mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To customize style for printing, you may define CSS rules in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">@media print {
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="slide-attributes"><span class="section-number">5.</span> Slide attributes</h2>
<p>You can add more attributes to a slide via an HTML comment that starts with <code>#</code>
(<code>Cmd / Ctrl + Shift + C</code> in RStudio‚Äôs visual Markdown editor), e.g.,</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!--# class=&quot;inverse&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot;
contenteditable --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The syntax is just HTML. These attributes will be added to the slide container:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class=&quot;slide inverse&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot; contenteditable&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="built-in-classes"><span class="section-number">5.1</span> Built-in classes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>inverse</code>: Apply a dark background and invert the slide color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>center</code>: Center all elements horizontally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>middle</code>: Center all elements vertically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>fade</code>: Fade a slide (50% opacity) and apply grid lines to the background
(can be useful for de-emphasizing a slide).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can define your own arbitrary class names (e.g., <code>&lt;!--# class=&quot;large&quot; --&gt;</code>)
and corresponding CSS rules (e.g., <code>.large { font-size: 150%; }</code>).</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="example-an-inverse-slide"><span class="section-number">5.2</span> Example: an inverse slide</h3>
<!--# class="inverse" style="font-size: 130%;" -->
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!--# class=&quot;inverse&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 130%;&quot; --&gt;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The background is (nearly) black and the text is white.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The font size is 30% larger.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="example-center-content"><span class="section-number">5.3</span> Example: center content</h3>
<!--# class="middle center" -->
<p>Everything is centered both vertically and horizontally.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!--# class=&quot;middle center&quot; --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you don‚Äôt have to use both classes at the same time. Depending on how
you want to center content, you can use one of these classes.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="example-fade-a-slide"><span class="section-number">5.4</span> Example: fade a slide</h3>
<!--# class="fade" -->
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!--# class=&quot;fade&quot; --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This slide is not important. You do not need to read it carefully. You can even
take a nap, since the speaker is boring.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="example-a-background-image"><span class="section-number">5.5</span> Example: a background image</h3>
<!--# style="background-image: url(https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/163582/219277796-6d2dd826-fb11-4970-b07c-dd920a694e3b.jpg); background-size: cover; color: lightgreen;" -->
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!--#
style=&quot;background-image: url(path/to/image);&quot;
--&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We use the <code>style</code> attribute to introduce a background image to this slide. You
can learn more about the <code>background-image</code> property
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.php">here</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="example-an-editable-slide"><span class="section-number">5.6</span> Example: an editable slide</h3>
<!--# contenteditable style="font-family: fantasy, monospace;" -->
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!--# contenteditable --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Believe it or not, this slide is editable because we have enabled the
<code>contenteditable</code> attribute. If you find any mistake on your slide during your
presentation, you can click on it and edit any text.</p>
<p>Note that your edits <em>will not</em> be saved, though.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="miscellaneous-elements"><span class="section-number">6.</span> Miscellaneous elements</h2>
<h3 id="page-numbers"><span class="section-number">6.1</span> Page numbers</h3>
<p>They are placed in <code>&lt;span class=&quot;page-number&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> at the bottom right of
all slides.</p>
<p>If you click on a page number, the URL of the presentation will be appended by a
hash of the form <code>#N</code>, where <code>N</code> is the page number. You can share this URL with
other people when you want to point them to a specific page in the slides.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="timer"><span class="section-number">6.2</span> Timer</h3>
<p>A timer is added to the bottom left in <code>&lt;span class=&quot;timer&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> by default.
If you want a <em>countdown</em> timer, you can add a custom <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> to your document
(in Markdown, you can use a raw HTML block <code>```{=html}</code>), and specify
the total number of seconds in the attribute <code>data-total</code>, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;span class=&quot;timer&quot; data-total=&quot;1200&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The timer will start when the presentation becomes fullscreen. To restart the
timer, click on it.</p>
<p>For the countdown timer, when the time is up, the timer will start to blink.</p>
<span class="timer" data-total="1200"></span>
<hr />
<h2 id="caveats"><span class="section-number">7.</span> Caveats</h2>
<h3 id="lengthy-slides"><span class="section-number">7.1</span> Lengthy slides</h3>
<!--# class="extend" -->
<p>When the height of a slide exceeds the window height, you need to be careful
because it can be easy to accidentally scroll to the next page as you approach
the bottom of the slide.</p>
<p>One solution is to add more space to the bottom of the slide using the <code>extend</code>
class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!--# class=&quot;extend&quot; --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This will add a placeholder with the class <code>spacer</code> to the end of the slide.
This placeholder has a height of <code>50vh</code>, i.e., half of the window height (you
can customize it via CSS). That means as soon as the bottom of the slide reaches
the middle of the screen, you will be navigated to the next slide. Be careful!
If you move from an oversized slide to the next slide by accident, you <em>will
not</em> be able to move back to the bottom of the previous slide directly! Instead,
you will always be navigated to the top of the previous slide if you want to go
back. When you are on a long slide, I recommend that you use your mouse wheel or
the <code>Down</code> arrow key to scroll at small steps, instead of using the <code>PageDown</code>
key to scroll over to the next screen at once.</p>
<p>Because of this hassle, you may not really want to make a slide lengthy, but it
may be unavoidable when you have lengthy content to show on one slide and it
cannot be broken. Below is a toy example (the output block cannot be split onto
two slides):</p>
<pre><code class="language-r">cat(1:10, sep = &quot;\n&quot;)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="aspect-ratio"><span class="section-number">7.2</span> Aspect ratio</h3>
<!--# class="extend" -->
<p>The aspect ratio of slides is not defined by default. The content will fit all
available space on the screen. If you present the slides directly with your own
computer, this may not be a problem since you know if all content fits well on
your own screen. However, if you connect your computer to a projector or present
the slides on another computer, you‚Äôd better know the screen resolution
beforehand, because the aspect ratio may be different, and your slides can look
different on that screen.</p>
<p>You can fix the aspect ratio by setting the body width in CSS. For example, if
your computer screen‚Äôs resolution is 900 √ó 1440, and you want the aspect ratio
4:3, you should set the body width to 1200px (= 900 √ó 4/3).</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">body { width: 1200px; }
</code></pre>
<p>Or set the width to a proportion of the height. A relative value will work with
any screen height, e.g., 4/3 ‚âà 1.33:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">body { width: 133vh; }
</code></pre>
<p>However, note that when the presentation is not fullscreen, the slides will not
take the full screen height (the browser UI elements such as the menu and tool
bar will take some vertical space), so <code>133vh</code> will be an underestimate of the
width.</p>

<p>How does this HTML presentation work under the hood?</p>
<h3 id="the-original-html"><span class="section-number">8.1</span> The original HTML</h3>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h2&gt;First slide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This can be generated from Markdown.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="snap-js"><span class="section-number">8.2</span> snap.js</h3>
<p>The script
<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/markdown/blob/master/inst/resources/snap.js"><code>snap.js</code></a>
converts HTML to a structure more convenient to style as slides:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class=&quot;slide-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;slide&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;First slide&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Content&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;slide&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Second slide&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More content&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h3 id="snap-css"><span class="section-number">8.3</span> snap.css</h3>
<p>The core technique is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scroll_Snap/Basic_concepts">CSS Scroll
Snap</a>.
The full CSS is
<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/markdown/blob/master/inst/resources/snap.css"><code>snap.css</code></a>,
and the essential rules are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">html {
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
}
.slide {
  min-height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-align: start;
}
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>The JS and CSS code can be used outside the R package <strong>markdown</strong>, too. You
just need to have the correct HTML structure. Then in your HTML document:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rstudio/markdown@VERSION/inst/resources/snap.min.js&quot; defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/combine/gh/rstudio/markdown@VERSION/inst/resources/default.min.css,gh/rstudio/markdown@VERSION/inst/resources/snap.min.css&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Remember to substitute <code>VERSION</code> with <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/markdown/tags">an appropriate
version</a> (e.g., <code>1.11</code>). You can omit
<code>@VERSION</code> to use the latest version but it is not recommended because future
updates might break your old slides.</p>
<p>Both the JS and CSS are quite lightweight (total size is
8.6 Kb
when uncompressed) and have no dependencies. They were written from scratch.</p>
