This Shiny App presents the Results of a [Simulation Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05622) to Evaluate the Performance Characteristics of Statistical Methods for the Analysis of Time-To-Event Data Under Non-Proportional Hazards.

Generating the hosted files needs access to the raw results of the simulation study that are not yet published. With access to the results data the the app can be generated with the `export.R` script which in turn uses the `prepare.R` script.
