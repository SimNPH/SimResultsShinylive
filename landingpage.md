## Interactive Presentation of Simulation Results

This shiny app includes visualisations of the simulated scenarios as well as the simulation results for the simulations conducted in for my master thesis "Implementation of a Simulation Study to Evaluate the Performance Characteristics of Statistical Methods for Analysis of Time to Event Data under Non-Proportional Hazard"

## Shinylive

The app takes a few minutes to load when visiting the page for the first time or after emptying the browser cache, please be patient. This app uses shinylive, all R code runs locally in your browser and therefore depending on your computer and browser might be slow. 

### Browser support

Unfortunately the app does not run in a usable speed in current Firefox releases (as of January 2024). According to the bugtracker the firefox team is already working on the issue.  
Please use a chrome based browser (chrome, edge, chromium, ...) in the meantime.

I was not yet (January 2024) able to test the app in safari. If loading the app or generating the plots takes long, also try using the app from a chrome based browser.
