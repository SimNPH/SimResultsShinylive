## Interactive Presentation of Simulation Results

This shiny app includes visualisations of the simulated scenarios as well as the simulation results for the simulations conducted in for my master thesis "Implementation of a Simulation Study to Evaluate the Performance Characteristics of Statistical Methods for Analysis of Time to Event Data under Non-Proportional Hazard"

Both sections contain a filter to select scenarios in the left panel. After selecting the scenario plots and tables can be redrawn using the "redraw" button.

## Scenarios

In this panel survival function, hazard function and hazard ratio of the two arms of the selected scenario are plotted and a table of summary statistics of the corresponding scenario is drawn.

## Simulation Results

In this panel a combined trellis/nested-loop plot of the selected scenarios is drawn. Methods and performance measures can be selected.
